The conflict has also spread on social networks, where both the invader and the invaded are responsible for building their own story. Objectives: To carry out a comparative analysis of the social audience on Twitter of the profiles of the Government of the Russian Federation (@GovernmentRF) and the Office of the President of Ukraine (@APUkraine). Methodology: Two social analytics tools based on the application of audience intelligence algorithms have been used, with a double objective: on the one hand, to carry out an analysis of the composition of the social audience of the chosen profiles; and on the other hand, through the choice of keywords, identify which profiles achieve greater reach and authority. Discussion and results: The applications have allowed us to study the audiences of the two selected profiles, providing a detailed description of the segments or communities that shape that audience, their demographic and psychographic data, while allowing segments to be connected. of audiences with other social listening and analytics platforms, influencer marketing tools, digital advertising platforms and other social analytics applications. Conclusions: The analysis carried out is of great importance to know the profile and interests of the Twitter audience of the followers of the official accounts of Russia and Ukraine, showing that words such as ""no war"" or ""reject"" are among the most repeated. in the tweets published between March 18 and April 17, 2022, as well as Hashtags about cities hit by war are the most used in these publications. © 2023, University of La Laguna.

The majority of this research, though, takes the perspective of a sponsoring brand, advising companies on how best to partner with an influencer to reap brand benefits. As influencers are also brands, research is needed to aid influencers with their own brand management strategies. Thus, we examine influencers as brands, exploring activism efforts by influencers. Results from three studies show that while activism positively affects consumers’ attitudes toward the influencer, expectations for future activism activities also increase. Furthermore, improved consumer attitudes are predicated upon continued support. Specifically, failure to meet activism expectations results in reduced perceptions of authenticity and attitudes, suggesting that activism as a means to benefit the influencer is only effective if it is continued. Implications for influencers and traditional brands and contributions to theory are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

We innovatively proposed using image richness to measure the visual contents by adopting a deep learning algorithm. We collected images embedded in posts by influencers from Sina Weibo and investigated how image richness affects customer engagement. Results show that image richness is positively related with emotional engagement and behavioral engagement, while negatively connected with cognitive engagement. Further, we find that the effect of image richness on customer engagement is more pronounced for experience goods and posters with greater social influence. However, the relationship is weakened by posts' text length, especially for emotional and cognitive engagement.

They can also be influenced by those who follow them through shared information, goals, news, and opinions. Generally, an influencer is someone who entices an influence to do the same action, make the same decision, or change their behavior. He can also communicate information, ideas, and thoughts to multiple users. There are many tools to identify influencers. It can not be found simply through their big follower number or their shared media number. Thus, influencer identification is one of the essential tasks in social media research. Several approaches and metrics have been proposed in the literature to identify influencers. In this article, we explored the issue of identifying social media influencers while providing a generic view of social media influence. First, we presented a literature synthesis on the influence of social media. Then, we categorized the works and illustrated the leading solutions in literature to identify influencers in social media. A discussion and suggestions for potential future directions in this area accompanied this presentation. We believe these briefings are critical to resolving the issue discussed in this article. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature."

To combat this spread, this paper analyzes social media dialogue surrounding Proud Boys protests from multiple perspectives to understand: (i) the outlook and profiles of users who support and reject Proud Boys; (ii) the network structure to determine influencers and communities; and (iii) the degree of engagement of tweets and the activity of their authors. The analyses indicate that conservative, religious, right-wing segments of the populace support Proud Boys, and their support is rooted in patriotism and defense of American values. Socialists and progressives oppose their radical and hateful ideology. Proud Boys’ topic network is fragmented with low density and is comprised of distinct, small communities. Authors of opposing tweets have a more extensive set of friends and followers, and their tweets receive more likes and retweets. Based on these results, it can be inferred that tweets endorsing Proud Boys’ ideology do not appear to proliferate virally, but instead reach limited audiences through smaller clusters. These analyses and results then form the basis of a classification framework, which can accurately detect tweets supportive of Proud Boys with an accuracy of 0.84 and AUC ROC of 0.89. The capability of the framework to identify and demote supporting tweets offers an extra layer of mitigation that can be employed to stem their spread. The research showcases the promise of mining social media feeds to understand why and how radical extremism spreads and is a gateway for future researchers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature."

In this exploratory study, we demonstrate that influencer industry ethics is more complex. We interviewed 28 representatives from different actor groups in the German influencer industry (influencers, client organizations, and intermediaries such as influencer marketing agencies) to systematically identify ethical issues and the moral expectations underlying these issues. In analyzing the interview data in a qualitative content analysis, we identify ten ethical issues: autonomy, transparency, sincerity, truthfulness, caring, professionalism, reciprocity, respect, loyalty, and social responsibility. Our study adds to the body of knowledge by further substantiating the discussion on transparency, payments, and authenticity; by introducing previously neglected ethical issues; by organizing the field of influencer industry ethics; and by explaining how the specific constellation of ethical issues in the influencer industry levels out the distinction between sponsored and organic content. In doing so, we argue for a broad perspective on influencer industry ethics that positions influencer communication at the intersection between Public Relations, advertising, and journalism. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

Among this content is an abundance of idealized portrayals of motherhood, which may be putting increased pressure on mothers and negatively affecting their mental health. This study was designed to provide evidence that new mothers make comparisons to motherhood portrayals on social media and that exposure to idealized portrayals can have harmful effects. In an online experiment, 464 new mothers (i.e., mothers with a child 3 years old or younger) in the United States were exposed to 20 Instagram posts portraying motherhood that varied in idealization (i.e., idealized vs. non-idealized portrayal) and source (i.e., posted by a mommy influencer vs. an everyday mother). The mothers then responded to measures including state social comparison, perceived similarity, envy, and state anxiety. The findings illustrate that new mothers make greater social comparisons and perceive more similarity to portrayals that are non-idealized (vs. idealized) and to portrayals that are from everyday social media mothers (vs. mommy influencers). Regardless of the source (everyday mother or mommy influencer), idealized posts cause significantly higher levels of envy and state anxiety, which may be detrimental to mothers’ mental health. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Specifically, the use of idealized women's bodies in different sectors of promotion and on social media has been subject to much criticism. The awareness of the negative outcomes of objectifying content triggered movements towards natural body exposure. However, empirical studies on the perceived effectiveness of this use are still needed. In this article, we compare how idealized versus natural women's bodies are perceived by Instagram users by means of an experimental procedure conducted with 700 users of this platform. We apply the Mann-Whitney U test and PLS-SEM to evaluate how physical attractiveness and idealization are related to the objectifying gazes. Our results suggest that overall publishing potentially objectifying content online is an accepted behavior, especially for more active Instagram users. Besides, both extremes of attractiveness, i.e. idealized beauty and perceived lack of attractiveness are subjected to stronger objectifying, than more natural-looking models. Thus, our paper contributes theoretically and empirically to the research on objectification by extending our knowledge of the factors that drive objectification and its acceptance among social media users. The implications of the emphasis on female bodily appearance on digital presence and the practices of digital influencers are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

While the use of social media applications in adolescents has proliferated, little is known about the content of food promotions within these applications. The aim of this study was to investigate adolescents’ exposure to and evaluation of social media food promotions (SMFPs). Methods: Australian adolescents aged 13–16 years joined one-on-one Zoom meetings with the researcher on the device they normally used for social media. Participants shared their screen and visited up to three of their favourite social media platforms for 10 min each, during which the researcher pointed out examples of SMFPs to participants. Next, participants answered questions about their awareness and appreciation of SMFPs. Screenshots of SMFPs were de-identified and analysed. Results: The study included 35 adolescents aged 14.4 (± 1.2) years (boys: n = 18; girls: n = 17). Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube were the most favoured social media platforms. During a total of 1000 min of viewing time, 1801 unbranded (n = 1221) and branded (n = 580) SMFPs were identified. Participants viewed a median rate (IQR) of 12.0 (6.3–20) SMFPs per 10 min, with a median rate of 6.0 (3–11) non-core SMFPs per 10 min. A majority of SMFPs (62%) were embedded into celebrity influencer or entertaining content (e.g., vlogs, cooking videos, streamed TV content). In total, 60% of the participants said they had sometimes, rarely or never noticed the SMFPs pointed out by the researcher themselves. Participants largely remembered non-core foods or brands (77%). Almost half (49%) of participants liked SMFPs, while only 6% disliked them. Conclusions: This study contributes to a relatively unexplored research area. The outcomes show adolescents’ SMFP exposure mostly concerns unhealthy foods, shown in advertisements and other food-related posts, which are integrated into a wide variety of entertainment that is appreciated by adolescents. The results emphasise the need for more research on SMFPs, with particular focus on the impact on adolescent dietary behaviours, and clearer definitions and stricter regulations regarding adolescent-targeted social media food marketing. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Understanding how the information circulated and evolved on social media platforms is essential for planning future public health campaigns. This study investigated what types of themes about COVID-19 were most viewed on YouTube during the first 8 months of the pandemic, and how COVID-19 themes progressed over this period. Methods: We analyzed top-viewed YouTube COVID-19-related videos in English from December 1, 2019 to August 16, 2020 with an open inductive content analysis. We coded 536 videos associated with 1.1 billion views across the study period. East Asian countries were the first to report the virus, while most of the top-viewed videos in English were from the US. Videos from straight news outlets dominated the top-viewed videos throughout the outbreak, and public health authorities contributed the fewest. Although straight news was the dominant COVID-19 video source with various types of themes, its viewership per video was similar to that for entertainment news and YouTubers after March. Results: We found, first, that collective public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic on YouTube peaked around March 2020, before the outbreak peaked, and flattened afterwards despite a spike in worldwide cases. Second, more videos focused on prevention early on, but videos with political themes increased through time. Third, regarding prevention and control measures, masking received much less attention than lockdown and social distancing in the study period. Conclusion: Our study suggests that a transition of focus from science to politics on social media intensified the COVID-19 infodemic and may have weakened mitigation measures during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is recommended that authorities should consider co-operating with reputable social media influencers to promote health campaigns and improve health literacy. In addition, given high levels of globalization of social platforms and polarization of users, tailoring communication towards different digital communities is likely to be essential. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Our research examined COVID-19-related crisis messages across Canadian influencer accounts within news media, politicians, public health and government, science communicators, and brand influencer and celebrities, posted on Instagram between December 2019 and March 2021 for Health Belief Model and Extended Parallel Processing Model constructs and the corresponding public comment sentiment and engagement. Thirty-three influencer accounts resulted in a total of 2,642 Instagram posts collected, along with 461,436 comments, which showed overall low use of constructs in both captions and images. Further, most posts used no combinations (n = 0 or 1 construct per post) of constructs in captions and images and very infrequently used captions that combined threat (severity and susceptibility) with cues to action and efficacy. Brand influencers and celebrities, politicians, and science communicators had above average post engagement while public health and government and news media had lower. Finally, most influencers saw the largest proportion of neutral sentiment comments. Crisis messages must be designed to include combinations of constructs that increase message acceptance and influence risk perception and efficacy to increase the adoption of recommended and mandated behaviours. © 2022, The Author(s)."

A deliberate and thoughtful social media campaign has the potential to increase the reach of the conference and allow for augmented engagement. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered a radical transformation in not just the delivery of healthcare but also the dissemination of science within the medical community. In the past, in-person medical conferences were an integral annual tradition for most medical professionals to stay up to date with the latest in the field. Social distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in either cancelling medical conferences or shifting to a virtual format. Following suit, for the first time in its history, the 2021 Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) annual meeting was an all-virtual event. This called for a modified social media strategy which aimed to re-create the sociability of an in-person conference whilst also promoting global dissemination of the science being presented.

Consequently, analysing online conversations, for example, to predict election outcomes, is becoming a popular and challenging research area. On social networking sites, citizens express themselves spontaneously regarding political topics, often driven by specific events in social life. Real-time analysis of social media can provide valuable feedback and insights to both politicians and news agencies. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a system for tracking and analysing social media. The SocMINT system provides an easy-to-use, visual dashboard to monitor the discussion on specific topics, to capture trends in communities and, by iteratively applying multidimensional data analysis and filtering, to deeply analyse posts and influencers. SocMINT aggregates data from multiple social sources and performs sentiment analysis on textual, visual and mixed content via a specifically designed neural network architecture. The system was applied in a real context by administrative staff of a political party to effectively analyse candidates’ political communication on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and the related online community reactions and discussion.

Social media have transformed the world. The rapid and large choice of these technologies is transforming how we find communities, how we get information from the news. According to this growth of social media, cyber terrorism has become an international issue that threatens world peace. Cyberterrorism is becoming more famous on social media now. While the Internet grows more pervasive in every area interested users or organizations can use the anonymity provided by cyberspace to terrorize citizens, communities, specific groups, and entire countries, without the internal threat of capture, damage, or death to the criminal that being physically existing would begin. Besides, Social network analysis plays a key research field for detecting different groups in a cyber-terrorist network. Many researchers are interested to find these communities, the managers, and the influencers which present a predictive way to protect users of social media networks. Then, the enormous evolution of terrorist communities over time presents a big problem to analyze and detect them. In this article, we introduce a new method for communities detection according to the network of contact, the publications, and their evolution based on Twitter as a social network. Also, we find the managers and the influencers in terrorist communities using swarm techniques. Our proposed method object is to optimize our proposed objective function to have a coherent partitioning inspired by the artificial bees comportment and using the data warehouse to save data in every evolution over time. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our proposed method by an experimental study on the real and artificial network and with a comparative study with the same related recent works. We test the performance of our approach by applying different quality functions on the terrorist communities detected. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature."

Dupe influencers sell fake luxury goods online to their cadres of followers, who relate to the influencers’ fashion savviness and who trust their judgment of products’ quality. In this article, I provide a synopsis of a case Amazon settled against two dupe influencers who used social media to promote the sale of counterfeit luxury products. I highlight the persistent challenge of luxury counterfeits sold online, the consumer complicity of obtaining luxury fakes, and the problem of discerning a knockoff from a counterfeit product. Dupe influencers leverage trust with their followers and use social media tactics, such as unboxing videos and designer haul promotions, to peddle luxury fakes. Recommendations to combat dupe influencers center on monitoring and working with e-commerce platforms to shut down social media posts that infringe a company's intellectual property, raising consumer awareness of the illicit activities of counterfeiters through education campaigns, leveraging legitimate social influencers to debunk the dupe influencers, and pursuing legal remedies. © 2022 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University"

A virtual influencer is an entity—humanlike or not—that is autonomously controlled by artificial intelligence and visually presented as an interactive, real-time rendered being in a digital environment. As brands increasingly seek to engage virtual influencers to connect with and sell to audiences, we take a step back and discuss the opportunities and challenges they present for firms and managers.

It is precisely this complexity which motivated this work, which proposes a composite index as a tool to measure engagement. Using TOPSIS, a multicriteria method that bases its ranking on minimizing the distance to the ideal point and maximizing the distance to the anti-ideal, a mix of indicators based on two approaches is used: the tweet approach and the follower approach. The former reflects engagement based on user production, and the latter measures engagement by popularity. This index was applied to a group of Social Media Influencers and a general ranking was obtained, as well as a ranking by each approach to measuring engagement. A comparison of the rankings generated by the different approaches shows the suitability and pertinence of both, as it is confirmed that they measure different aspects, and that both are needed to offer a holistic view of the engagement generated by a user on Twitter; this is a new finding compared to prior studies, which only focused on one approach or the other. © 1957 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

However, this literature has barely considered the possible perception of risk associated with these recommendations on the part of consumers or the involvement of users with the product in their purchase intention. This paper fills this gap in the literature by analysing the possible interconnection between observational learning, product involvement and perceived risk on the effectiveness of influencers' recommendations. To this end, we propose a new exploratory model applying an approach grounded in observational learning and an extension of the theory of planned behaviour, analysed by means of PLS-SEM in a sample of 948 followers of influencers who recommend fashion products. The results have new implications for influencer marketing research by reporting the impact of risk on product attitude and purchase intention, although their predictive power was lower than expected. Furthermore, perceived authenticity of the message exerted the highest positive effect on attitude, and it was established as a significant mitigator of user-perceived risk. Finally, product involvement, a construct unexplored in previous studies, revealed a considerable influence on both perceived authenticity of the message and attitude. © 2022 The Author(s)"

The biggest dietary gatekeepers of children are their parents and more specifically mothers, whose attitudes and consumption choices are nowadays often affected by the opinions of influencers on social network sites (SNSs). Using two experimental studies, the current paper investigates how mothers’ food assessments and decisions for their children are affected by sponsored posts on social media. The first study adopted a two-level between-subjects experiment (N = 81), which showed that mothers like sponsored Instagram posts better when they are posted by a mom influencer (i.e. a mother who accumulated a large following on social media and often engages in sponsored partnerships with brands) compared to a brand. This consequently positively affected source credibility, post engagement, purchase intention and the child appropriateness of the food. In the second experiment, a two-by-two between-subjects design (N = 169) showed that while a typical mom influencer is perceived as less effective in promoting food compared to an expert (i.e. a pediatric nutritionist) mom influencer due to lower credibility, a typical mom influencer is more efficient in promoting unhealthy foods through higher influencer-brand congruence. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Through four studies deploying a mixed method design (total N = 888), we redress this knowledge gap. We find that increased depth and breadth in social self-disclosure is viewed as inappropriate, reducing trust and purchase intent. We further validate appropriateness as the critical mediator in understanding the impact of self-disclosure within this marketing context. We also establish that the context of the post (sponsored vs non-sponsored) and the audiences’ social media usage intensity together act as a boundary condition to the effects of high self-disclosure by SMI's. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

The study combines social network analysis with in-depth interviews to adopt a more holistic framework for studying online opinion leadership in the context of public relations research. Ultimately, results from this study extend the network paradigm in public relations by examining the role of individual users in the construction of the discursive landscape around issue networks.

Methods and Materials: NodeXL Pro was used to prospectively sample all tweets with the hashtag #radonc every 8 to 10 days during the course of 1 year (December 4, 2018, to November 29, 2019). Twitter handles were grouped into conversational clusters using the Clauset-Newman-Moore community detection algorithm. For each sample period, the top 10 #radonc Twitter influencers, defined using betweenness centrality, were categorized. Influencers were scored in each sample period according to their top 10 influence rank and summarized with descriptive statistics. Linear regression assessed for characteristics that predicted higher influence scores among top influencers. Results: In the study, 684,000 tweets were sampled over 38 periods. #radonc tweets took on the crowd superstructure of a hub-and-spoke broadcast network formed when prominent individuals are widely repeated by many audience members. Professional societies were the most influential category of Twitter handles with an average influence score of 7.63 out of 10 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.94). When industry handles were present among top 10 influencers, they exhibited the second highest average influence scores (6.75, SD = 1.06), followed by individuals with scores of 5.28 (SD = 0.43). The categories of influencers were stable during the course of 1 year. The role of attending physician, radiation oncology specialty, male sex, academic practice, and US-based handles in North America were predictors of higher influence score. Conclusions: Twitter influencers in radiation oncology represent a diverse group of people and organizations, but male academic radiation oncologists based in North America occupy particularly influential positions in virtual communities broadly characterized as “hub and spoke” broadcast networks. Periodic network-based analyses of the social media discourse in radiation oncology are warranted to maintain an awareness of the handles that are influencing discussions on Twitter and ensure that social media utilization continues to contribute to the field of radiation oncology in a meaningful way. © 2022 The Author(s)"

Individuals decide whether to pay or to evade taxes considering the expected economic net benefit and the reputational cost from tax evasion. Individuals differ in income and in the weight they attach to social reputation, which is updated by assessing the opinions shared in their reference group. The reference group contains individuals irrespective of their income (integrated society) or it is made up of peers belonging to the same income group (segregated society). We simulate the model in the two alternative settings to find the frequency distribution of taxpayers in a dataset of random networks. The results indicate that, in an integrated society, network conformity is reached and all individuals either evade or pay their taxes. Conversely, a segregated society might generate obstacles to the diffusion of opinions and, as a result, tax evasion and tax compliance might coexist. Lastly, we consider the effects of a social media campaign starring a celebrity financed by a fiscal authority to increase overall tax compliance by exploiting the diffusion dynamics in the network. We show that such a policy is more effective if the diffusion of opinions is not hindered by social segregation. In an integrated society, especially if income inequality is low, a celebrity's endorsement of tax compliance might nudge widespread socially responsible tax behaviour. © 2022 The Authors.

It opens up new perspectives on digital leisure and internet celebrity culture, and asks important questions about the social, cultural and psychological implications of our contemporary relationship with digital media. Drawing on cutting-edge social theory, the book explores a wide range of contexts in which DGM intersects with digital leisure, from the health-related learning of young people to the 'clean eating' movement, to the online lives of fitness professionals. It seeks to move beyond asking if digital and social media are problematic per se and explores the problems a turn to the Internet could be revealing about the lack of real-world or analogue support, as well as potential solutions, for our wellness, health and fitness needs and wants.

Virtual influencers often evoke discussions about human nature because their cyberpunk narratives and uncanny appearance position them as autonomous posthuman subjects. Virtual influencers are positioned as Bodies without Organs, as their bodies can be manipulated into any form. Yet, they adhere to normative ideals of youth, slimness and beauty, encouraging their audiences to follow suit. Their fashion reflects the streetwear aesthetic but is often designed by luxury brands. This strategy positions virtual influencers as authentic, while generating visibility within the attention economy. Further, the Deleuzian concept of the fold serves as a metaphor to understand fashion as an interface between surface and depth. It is fashion in its folded form that hominizes virtual influencers, although they are merely a fashionable surface. © 2022 Intellect Ltd."

The content is the bridge between the product and its customers. Evaluating the user’s content creation is a valuable feature to improve information spreading on the social network. This paper proposes a method for extracting brand value with influencers by combining the user’s amplification and content creation in influencer marketing. The amplification factors are studied based on the propagation of the posts on the social network in a duration time. Those factors are more valuable than before when using influencer marketing at a determined time. Moreover, the content creation score is also studied to measure content creation based on the passion point with a brand and its quality. The amplification factors and content creation score are combined to analyze posts’ interest in detecting the emerging influent users for a product in the influencer marketing campaign. Using the amplification factors, the passion points, and the content creation score, a system to manage the influencer marketing on Facebook has been constructed and tested in the real-world campaign. The experimental results show that the proposed method’s influencers bring the conversion rate’s efficiency and revenue in the influencer marketing campaign. © 2022 Huynh et al.

We conducted twenty-two in-depth semi-structured interviews with senior management marketing professionals across different sectors. Our analysis of these narratives shows that B2B marketers advocate the concept of ‘influential marketing’ by differentiating it from the concept of influencer marketing in the B2C market. B2B influential marketing connotes trustworthiness, expertise, professionalism, and exchange of know-how, all of which are rooted in long-term and industry-specific relationships and business networks. This research contributes to the theorisation of B2B influential marketing by developing an integrated framework that deciphers the process of its strategic implementation.

Our main objective is to explore the impact of follower status on parasocial relations (PSRs) with SMIs considering the moderating role of the involvement with the product the SMI is advertising on Instagram. Furthermore, we investigate how follower status, mediated by PSRs and the SMI's credibility, has an impact on the effectiveness of the persuasive process and contributes to SMIs' social influence in online environments. We worked together with an actual female SMI with 12,000 followers who posts content on Instagram. Contrary to our predictions, our results showed that being a follower on Instagram does not necessarily mean having a PSR with an SMI. Product involvement has a moderating role in the sense that only those followers who report having high involvement have a strong PSR with the SMI. Moreover, a PSR positively impacts the SMI's credibility, leading to positive attitudes toward the brand and increased intentions to purchase the advertised products and spread the content created by the SMI on social media. © 2022 The Authors"

Interested in wider cultural discourses about contemporary forms of ‘independent’ language work, this paper examines English-language news media representations of SMIs. The empirical focus of my analysis is a dataset of 143 news stories collected from major ‘broadsheet’ newspapers and LexisNexis. Specifically, I identify two contradictory stances – celebration and derision – by which SMIs are popularly framed. It is in this way, and following van Leeuwen (2007), that their cultural status and work is (de)legitimized. Using the legitimation tactics of theoretical rationalisation and mythopoesis, celebratory stances in my data construct SMIs as a perfect fit for today's ideal of entrepreneurial success – as ambitious, self-optimizing and risk-taking individuals – ultimately contributing to the recasting of independent and sometimes precarious employment as aspirational ‘entrepreneurship’. Conversely, derisory stances built on the legitimation tactics of moral evaluation and authorisation lament their lack of work ethic as well as their interloping into industries that do not want them. Thus, the news media appear to both applaud SMIs for their entrepreneurial careers and be vested in sanctioning them for foregoing gatekeepers by not following traditional career paths to stable employment. Ironically, and perhaps even hypocritically, the latter are precisely the kind of employment that are increasingly difficult for many young people to access while the former still prerequisite considerable privilege to be able to pursue. © 2022 The Author"

The complexity of health information, the role of expert intermediaries in disseminating information, and the information dynamics of social media create an environment where harmful misinformation spreads rapidly. However, little is known about the origin of this misinformation. This article explores the processes through which health misinformation from online marketplaces is legitimized and spread. Specifically, across one content analysis and two experimental studies, the authors investigate the role of highly legitimized influencer content in spreading vaccine misinformation. By analyzing a data set of social media posts and the websites where this content originates, the authors identify the legitimation processes that spread and normalize discussions about vaccine hesitancy (Study 1). Study 2 shows that expert cues increase the perceived legitimacy of misinformation, particularly for individuals who generally have positive attitudes toward vaccines. Study 3 demonstrates the role of expert legitimacy in driving consumers’ sharing behavior on social media. This research addresses a gap in the understanding of how pharmaceutical misinformation originates and becomes legitimized. Given the importance of the effective communication of vaccine information, the authors present key challenges for policy makers. © The Author(s) 2022."

It proposes that this appropriation parallels processes of professionalization, influencer culture, and self-branding on social media. Focusing empirically on the official Instagram accounts of 12 leading fashion brands, we identify three distinctive patterns: (1) Regramming: sharing and crediting users’ photographs on the brands’ official feed; (2) Vernacular celebrity: posting the amateur-style photographs of a celebrity or model associated with the brand; (3) Brandfies: selfie-style images created by corporations where the brand appears to be a “self” performing its own representation. We argue that these appropriations position brands more fully as social beings, as tech-savvy cultural amateurs familiar with platform affordances, and as physically embodied selves. Self-branding is thus systematically complemented and brought to fulfilment by brand-“selfing.” © The Author(s) 2022."

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the social exchange theory and after the text analysis of the data collected from the Tiktok platform in 2020, this paper uses the quantitative method to evaluate the factors influence KSB on short video social platform during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings: KSB on new media platform could be enhanced by richer knowledge content of the video posted and the attribute of the platform users directly. Platform users could affect the trustworthiness of the knowledge shared, thus influence the knowledge sharing. On the early stage of the COVID-19, the richer content of the knowledge released by users could effectively enhance the KSB. On the early stage of the emergency events, the official users could play a significant role on KS. During the mitigation stage of COVID-19, the KSB of the knowledge shared by unofficial users with richer content could be enhanced and the moderation effect is relatively stronger.

They are also sensitive to environmental problems and ecology. For this reason, the purpose of this paper was to identify the possibility of using influencer marketing to promote green energy in the perspective of Generation Z in Poland. The CAWI method of research was carried out April–June 2022 on a sample of 533 people aged 18 to 26, selected using a quota method.

Due to the particular complexity of a financial product, we assume that the credibility and trustworthiness of an influencer can lead to respondents being more willing to engage with financial products. Based on our survey results, we can provide first evidence that influencer marketing also has untapped potential for banks. Although our respondents revealed a certain skepticism towards this form of marketing, the results indicate a weak positive correlation between influencer marketing, customer engagement with the subject of financial products and ultimately the purchase of financial products. In this respect, our results are of particular interest to decision-makers in banks. However, they are also relevant for the whole of society.

Melanoma is a critical public health issue with a substantial economic burden. Cases and associated burdens, however, could be prevented with a greater awareness of, and interventions related to, skin cancer and melanoma-related preventive behaviors. In fact, as social media use is close to ubiquitous, it represents a potential communication modality. However, more research is needed to understand the current state of melanoma-related information exchanged between Twitter users. This study aimed to understand the different types of users controlling the melanoma-related information diffusion and conversation themes on Twitter. Methods: Tweets (n = 692) were imported from Twitter between 1 and 31 May 2021 using the Twitter public API; and uploaded to NodeXL to conduct a social network analysis. Results: Health professionals and organizations with medical backgrounds were the main content producers, disseminators, and top influencers. However, information diffusion is slow and uneven among users. Additionally, conversations lacked a focus on preventive behaviors. Conclusion: Twitter is a potential platform for the targeted outreach of individuals in melanoma awareness campaigns.

Hang's livestreams would humiliate celebrities, include personal attacks, criticize media and charity organizations, and use harassing language, resulting in the Vietnamese government regulating social media influencers. Vietnam is a centralized government that promotes the regulation of social media influencers to control the population by censoring content and banning certain discussion topics. This is exemplary of Vietnam's media regulatory environment: Vietnam wants to take advantage of the opportunities that new media and technology bring to promote economic integration, yet the Vietnamese government prefers to accept them by enforcing their adherence to local regulations via regulatory and economic measures. As a result, the Vietnamese government has increased control over livestreaming influencers: any social media account with more than 10,000 followers must provide account holders' contact information to government authorities. Further, social media platforms will be asked to remove content that has been flagged as problematic by government officials, shoring up Vietnam's view on regulation toward foreign social media platforms. These regulations allow the government to control the narrative around social issues and prevent dissenting voices from being heard.

This spans across governance from the “state” through government interventions and introduction of formal law, governance in the “industry” through sector-based guidelines and best practice recommendations, and governance in the “vernacular” from peer surveillance and the court of public opinion in civil society. Through mixed qualitative methodologies including traditional and digital participant observation, content analysis, archival research, document survey, and case study files, this paper aims to locate the current terms and boundaries of influencer governance and regulation in the verticals of “race & culture” and “sex & safety.” In “race & culture,” we consider how the majority-race Chinese influencers and minority-race Malay and Indian influencers are differently policed by the three tiers of governance, and experience uneven consequences. This includes commentary that is overtly racist, poor stereotypes that perpetuate everyday racism, and parody content that calls out systemic racism. In “sex & safety,” we consider how sexual harassment and assault are regulated in the industry. This includes the underbelly of the industry where some prominent influencers-cum-managers have been accused of sexual grooming and advances as part of their recruitment processes. It highlights how when women are provided an anonymous space to discuss sexual harassment, a tidal wave of stories emerge, leading to doxxing and the potential for vigilante justice. It also reveals how LGBT influencers and sexual offenders are policed more harshly, while sexual harassment against women take place without repercussion even when revealed. We end with a consideration of the state of influencer wellbeing and welfare in the industry, and the place of the law in regulating longstanding and emergent issues. © 2022 Policy Studies Organization."

The selected influencers were popular with adolescents, with a combined total of more than 34 million followers/subscribers. We employed the YouTube Influencer Marketing Protocol from the World Health Organization (WHO) as our basis for coding. We analysed a total of 360 videos/posts and, of these, 24% contained F&B cues, which is equivalent to 18.1 F&B cues/hour. In total, 77% of the cues were not permitted for children’s advertising, according to WHO criteria, and this was stable across all platforms, with chocolate and sugary confectionery (23%) as the most frequently featured products. Not-permitted F&B had a four-times higher chance of being branded, a five-times higher chance of being described positively, and received significantly more ‘likes’.

Methods This study analyzed tweets including the hashtag #menopause between November 2019 and November 2021. Tweets performed by international or national societies as well as expert social media influencers were included in the analysis. To analyze hashtag utilization amongst all Twitter users, hashtags from the ""Top""tweets Twitter search function from October 2021 were also analyzed. Co-occurring hashtags were recorded as well as the type of user who performed the tweet during the ""Top""tweets analysis. Social media influencers and experts reviewed and edited the hashtag list. The hashtags were then grouped by subject. Results We analyzed 382 tweets with #menopause. Of the users included in the ""Top""tweets, 40% were patient advocates or advocacy groups; 38% were medical professionals, academics, societies, or journals; and 22% were general users. In total, 123 unique hashtags were identified. After social media influencer and expert review, 32 hashtags were included in the final ontology. The ontology was then grouped into the following categories based on subject matter: general, premature menopause, hormones, sexual function, and genital disorders. Conclusions Social media is an important tool for medical professionals and patients. Our study is the first to develop a hashtag ontology specific to menopause. Adoption of a hashtag ontology with standardized terminology by medical professionals may facilitate easier communication with peers and patients. © The North American Menopause Society."

However, influencer identification is understudied, and most previous studies have only discussed visible characteristics of influencers and their social networks, overlooking content-based metrics. Combining interdisciplinary theories and techniques from marketing, linguistics, and computer science, we propose a data-driven automated text analysis framework to identify characteristics of effective influencers using influencer posts. Specifically, we propose a model that incorporates influencer personality traits captured by natural language processing, accounting for traditional covariates, such as network structure and follower engagement. In addition, we use a dataset that attributes influencer social media activities to customer purchases to address fake engagement and showcase our automated textual analysis.

However, little is known about how they build reputational capital and thus endorsement effectiveness, particularly compared to traditional celebrity endorsers. From a consumers' perspective, this research investigates both types of endorsers in different stages of the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle (CCLC). Across three studies, we find that parasocial relationships and interactions with consumers are paramount for SMIs reputational capital and endorsement effectiveness, yet not critical for traditional celebrities. Further, a consumer's perceived weak parasocial relationship/interaction with SMIs can be detrimental to their effectiveness yet has little impact on traditional celebrities' influence. We find that the positive effect of a SMI with high parasocial relationship/interaction with consumers on Word of Mouth (i.e., endorsers effectiveness) is mediated by expectation fulfillment and brand endorsers' credibility (i.e., reputation capital). This research discovers how important parasocial relationships with consumers are for SMIs in comparison to traditional celebrities; importantly this is the first research that empirically identifies how SMIs can gain and maintain reputation capital and subsequently be more effective as brand endorsers.

Commercial promotion of breast-milk substitutes (BMS) is one factor undermining breastfeeding globally. Although the International Code of Marketing of BMS prohibits all forms of marketing, promotion has been observed in digital environments. We aimed to understand the scope and impact of digital marketing for the promotion of BMS. Recent Findings: BMS are promoted strategically and in an integrated fashion across multiple digital channels (social media, manufacturer websites, online retailers, blogs, mobile apps and digital streaming services). Traditional marketing strategies like gifts, discounts and coupons are also disseminated digitally. Data mining, real-time direct-to-consumer advertising and partnering with peer-group social media influencers are additional avenues. Exposure to digital marketing is common. Research on the impact of digital marketing is scarce, but its negative impact on breastfeeding intention and initiation has been documented. Case reports from marketing industry press corroborate academic evidence by highlighting the benefits of digital marketing to BMS companies in recruiting new users and increasing sales. Summary: To protect and promote breastfeeding, coordinated global action and strengthened national measures will be needed to implement, monitor and enforce the International Code in a digital context. Further action could include voluntary restrictions on BMS marketing by social media platforms and greater use of government-led data and health privacy regulation. © 2022, The Author(s)."

The study identifies key persuasive communication components that influence individuals' attitudes and, subsequently, intentions to follow health-related information shared by SMIs. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and interactions with 332 active social media users via structured online questionnaires were used for data collection. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse responses. Findings: Results indicate that SMIs' credibility, SMI–individual homophily and quality of information shared by the SMI are the significant factors determining individuals' attitudes towards the information received. Furthermore, the individual's attitude significantly impacts their intention to follow information shared by the SMI. The study thus verifies the mediating role of attitude in persuasive communication. Research limitations/implications: The current study can serve as a foundation for future work to examine the suitability of SMIs for tasks other than marketing. Practical implications: The study provides insights for planning and implementing SMI-sourced communication in the public health context. The study enhances the understanding of the tested relationships and thereby increases scholars' and practitioners' ability to leverage SMIs for health-related communication. Originality/value: Whilst SMIs are attracting increasing attention in consumer markets, the study suggests that they can be used in public health communication.

Moreover, little is known about more positively oriented explanatory mechanisms, such as inspiration (i.e., feeling inspired by media to adopt a broader inner conception of beauty). Therefore, the current cross-sectional survey study among 458 women aged 19-30 years old (M = 22.76, SD = 2.64) investigated the links between exposure to nonidealized content on different media platforms, inspiration, and a broad conceptualization of beauty. Conditional process analysis, using Hayes' PROCESS tool, was performed. Our results indicated that exposure to nonidealized content through Instagram posts of influencers/celebrities as well as magazine articles was positively linked to women's broader conceptualization of beauty. Inspiration was also found to be a significant mediator in these relationships. Moreover, inspiration was found to fully mediate the relationship between exposure to nonidealized content through companies' Instagram posts and a broad conceptualization of beauty. No relationships were found for exposure to nonidealized content through television series or movies.

While influencers are a long-standing phenomenon in social media, virtual influencers have made their appearance on such platforms only recently: they are CGI characters that act like and resemble humans, even if they do not physically exist in the real world. This recent phenomenon has sparked interest in society, and several questions arise regarding their evolution, opinions, ethics, purpose in marketing, and future perspective. In this article, we conduct an exhaustive review of the virtual influencer phenomenon. Through an extensive study of the literature, press articles, social platforms data, blogs, and interviews, we give a comprehensive reflection on virtual influencers. Starting from their evolution, we analyze their opportunities and threats. We provide detailed information about the most popular ones and their marketing collaborations, with a comparative analysis of virtual and real (human) influencers. Moreover, we conducted an online survey to grasp people's perspectives. From the 360 participants' answers, we draw conclusions about virtual influencers' ethics, importance, overall feelings, and future. Results show controversial opinions on this recent phenomenon. © 1979-2012 IEEE."

As influencers endeavour to engage followers and increase their power of influence for commercial value, it can result in potential negative consequences to followers' wellbeing. This research explored how social media influencing may cause problematic engagement with influencers. To do so, we drew from attachment theory and used mixed methods, including a Delphi study and a survey with 500 Instagram users. Results suggested that influencer characteristics such as physical attractiveness, social attractiveness, and self-presence, as well as followers' participation comprehensiveness can foster followers' problematic engagement through the mediation of bond- and identity-based attachment (i.e., parasocial relationship and sense of belonging). Importantly, following more influencers weakened the effect of sense of belonging on problematic engagement, but not that of parasocial relationship. Overall, this study sheds light on negative aspects of social media influencing and provides useful insights to gauge social media influencers’ engagement tactics for a healthy follower behaviour and influencer outcomes. © 2022"

This research explored how social media influencers' intimate self-disclosure (SMIs' ISD) can shape perceptions of their credibility. An experiment examines how followers' relatedness need fulfillment and source credibility are affected. In general, people perceived high levels of SMIs' ISD as more damaging to their credibility than low levels of intimate self-disclosure. Boundary conditions are identified in the appropriateness of self-disclosure. That is, when participants felt that SMIs' ISD was appropriate, perceptions of SMIs' credibility were enhanced through the underlying mechanism of followers' relatedness need fulfillment. Results contribute to a better understanding of the application of intimate self-disclosure in digital marketing and advance our knowledge of the boundary conditions that affect the disclosure of high levels of intimacy by SMIs in a social media consumption context. The findings are also of direct relevance to companies attempting to enhance the persuasiveness of product promotions via followers’ relatedness need fulfillment and source credibility. © 2022"

We examined the (1) use of owned media by major unhealthy food and non-alcoholic beverage brands on TikTok and (2) nature of branded hashtag challenges instigated by such brands and the user-generated content created in response. Methods We assessed the (1) content of all videos posted on the accounts of 16 top food and non-alcoholic beverage brands (based on global brand share) as at 30 June 2021, and (2) content and sentiment of a sample of brand-relevant user-generated content created in response to branded hashtag challenges instigated by these brands. Results Of 539 videos posted by brands, 60% were posted in the first half of 2021. The most common marketing strategies were branding (87% of videos), product images (85%), engagement (31%) and celebrities/influencers (25%). Engagement included instigation of branded hashtag challenges that encouraged creation of user-generated content featuring brands' products, brands' videos and/or branded effects. The total collective views of user-generated content from single challenges ranged from 12.7 million to 107.9 billion. Of a sample of 626 brand-relevant videos generated in response to these challenges, 96% featured branding, 68% product images and 41% branded effects. Most portrayed a positive (73%) or neutral/unclear (25%) sentiment, with few negative (3%). Conclusion Unhealthy food and non-alcoholic beverage brands are using TikTok to market brands and products via their own accounts and to encourage users to create and share their own content that features branding and product images. Given TikTok's popularity among children, this study supports the need for policies that protect children from the harmful impact of food marketing on social networking platforms. ©"

By using a mixed-methods approach combining big data analysis with small ethnographic data analysis, we examine how conspiracy theories and spiritual ideas circulate, merge and crystallize in particular practices and encounters in Spain. The big data analysis of Twitter conversations reveals the centrality and hypervisibility of far-right populist influencers, and the predominance of classic conspiracy views over spiritual ones in anti-vax discourses. However, ethnographic observations and the analysis of digital ethnographic data of other social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube and Telegram) show the emergence and growth of a network of actors merging spiritual messages, alternative visions on health and healing, anti-vax views and conspiracy theories in different ways and degrees. These are the conspiritual assemblages, which are smaller and more local in their scale and impact but still significant in sociological terms. © 2022, Equinox Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this study, we aimed to determine the factors influencing public perceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccination using Twitter in order to inform efforts to improve vaccination rates. We collected tweets mentioning COVID vaccination in the Thai language during 13 January 2020-15 June 2021. The tweets were translated into English and the content of the tweets were determined and the number of tweets and likes were recorded. The sentiment of each tweet was classified into three categories: positive, negative and neutral, and the tweet trends were evaluated for the 7-day period before and 7-day period after selected vaccination campaign events. A total of 31,043 tweets were included in the analysis. Sentiment distribution analysis revealed the Thai Prime Minister’s vaccination (p = 0.0007) and a COVID-19 vaccine promotion campaign in the online media by medical experts (p<0.0001) significantly increased positive sentiment after those events. The day a Thai social media influencer received a COVID-19 vaccine resulted in the greatest number of tweets regarding COVID-19 vaccination (n =2,186) and resulted in a significant increase in positive sentiment regarding COVID-19 vaccination (p = 0.0280). In summary, public figure vaccination or promotion of COVID-19 vaccination significantly increased positive sentiment regarding COVID-19 vaccination. We conclude that public figures or medical professionals can improve public sentiment regarding vaccination and should be encouraged to support vaccination campaigns. Further studies are needed to determine if this increase in positive public sentiment will result in increased vaccination uptake. © 2022, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved."

Research has examined various but fragmented SMIs, which cause inconsistency in empirical results. This research seeks to categorise the most popular SMIs in luxury fashion and examine their distinctive effects on Gen Z consumption in China. Design/methodology/approach: The authors categorise SMIs into four groups based on two dimensions, i.e. network interactivity vs social connectedness. Drawing on the social network theory, the authors develop the research model. A sample of 400 survey data is collected and analysed using the PLS-SEM technique. Findings: The empirical results suggest that among the four popular SMIs groups, the effects of celebrities, opinion leaders and friends and peers on luxury fashion consumption of Gen Z are statistically significant while that of advertisers are insignificant; that friends and peers have the most substantial effect among the others.

Findings: The results demonstrate social media users are most inclined to respond to product-related topics, followed by the influencer, emotional, alcohol drinking intent, behavioral and skepticism. Meanwhile, the findings also revealed that the female group was more likely to engage in influencer topics, whereas the male group contributed more to product subjects. Gen Z cohort involved more themes about alcohol drinking intent, whereas Gen Y contributed more to skepticism.

The authors further evaluate the extent to which SMIs' ISD fosters consumers' self-brand connections via consumer-SMI parasocial relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The scale was developed through item generation, purification, and validation. First, items were generated from existing scales and revised based on feedback provided by experts. The items were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses using an online survey with 433 participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the predictive power of SMIs' ISD on parasocial relationships and self-brand connections. Findings: The results suggest that the perceived SMIs' ISD is a unidimensional construct. As proposed, SMIs' ISD enhances consumer-brand connections through the underlying mechanism of consumers' sense of being in a parasocial relationship with an SMI.

Nevertheless, this phenomenon is still under-researched. This study examined the impact of the imitation of influencers on customer buying intention toward endorsed products, which is mediated by social comparison, materialism and the fear of missing out (FOMO).

This study employed structural equation modeling to test for direct and indirect effects among the constructs. Findings: The results revealed that imitation of influencers has a significant impact on social comparison, materialism and FOMO, which affect buying intention toward endorsed products. The analysis results highlight the critical role of FOMO in explaining buying intention toward endorsed products in the context of social media influencers. Originality/value: This study proposes a new theoretical model and empirically tests the power of influencers to affect consumer buying intention for endorsed products.

In many cases, this environment, and especially its users, try to adapt to a celebrity network pattern on the basis of the construction of seemingly authentic and close relationships, leading to relevant phenomena such as parenting vlogs. This kind of content is focused on the presence of intimate moments that reflect the daily life of influencers or micro-influencers, capturing large numbers of followers, as well as important communication and information strategies. From this perspective, and through a quantitative content analysis of 1,034 videos and more than 900 viewing hours on two very popular YouTube family influencer channels, this study explores the degree of intimacy portrayed in their video content as performative strategies that configure the profiles’ post through interactions with followers, brands, and self-promotion. The results suggest that the degree of intimacy shown in this content becomes a performative process for these family youtubers, whereby the more intimate the exposure, the more popular the information offered to the user. In short, this type of content prioritizes the routines of the youtubers, who include their closest family members and friends as a means of attracting attention, while dedicating their time to interacting with brands (advertising) and recording, editing, and submitting a vast amount of personal and private information on the platform (dissemination) in a sort of promotional–private performativity. © 2022, El Profesional de la Informacion.

However, when they disclose their posts as an ad, their credibility might be weakened which can lead to less interest in the product. Moreover, influencer marketing strategies usually focus on personal benefits and experiences, while advertisements for sustainable products emphasize altruistic motives. The purpose of this study is to investigate if the interest in the product and the credibility might be affected by such different benefit appeals. Design/methodology/approach: A 2 (sponsorship: no disclosure vs disclosure) × 2 (benefit: ecological vs personal) between-subjects experiment with influencer posts promoting a sustainable travel accommodation was conducted to investigate how ad disclosures and benefits appeals affect the credibility of sustainability influencers and the interest in sustainable products among young consumers. Findings: Disclosures and benefits appeals have no direct impact on the interest in further information about the product but on the credibility of the influencer. If an Instagram post for a sustainable accommodation was labeled as sponsored, the perceived expertise and likeability of the influencer were diminished. However, highlighting personal benefits instead of ecological benefits increased the influencers’ credibility compared to appeals emphasizing benefits for the environment. Originality/value: In addition to sponsorship disclosures, other strategies of advertising literacy might be required to show young consumers how to cope with influencer advertising.

Rogue marketing is explored vis-à-vis a phenomenon that occurred over the summer of 2019 with a new product category, hard seltzers. It is proposed that rogue marketing occurs when an unaffiliated individual creates and posts an informal message about a brand on social media that becomes viral. Although the post is not funded or endorsed by the company that owns the brand, reaching viral status results in free and unexpected advertising (positive or negative). Design/methodology/approach: Rogue marketing is first explored through a comparative analysis with company produced advertisements. Then, the company’s response to rogue marketing is gauged through both qualitative and quantitative data. The sample of 210 respondents was recruited from students enrolled in college hospitality courses and through posts made on social media. Findings: Rogue marketing is found to be somewhat more compelling than company produced advertisements and those who found the rogue marketing message more compelling had stronger sentiments regarding the company’s response. Research limitations/implications: This exploratory study of rogue marketing provides a conceptualization and starting framework for future research concerning this phenomenon. Originality/value: Rogue marketing is a new phenomenon and is distinct from influencer marketing and viral marketing in its characteristics. Additionally, the company’s response to rogue marketing messages may influence behavioral outcomes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Stories fascinate people and can easily be remembered compared to the facts alone. The much-hyped feature “stories” of Instagram, a trendy social media platform, has become a game-changer for influencer marketing. The present study extends reactance theory in the context of Instagram’s millennial users. Previous researchers have tested the effectiveness of the stories feature of this particular social media platform. Therefore, in line with the earlier studies, we propose a sequential mediation model that investigates the effect of storytelling content (made by Instagram Influencers) on audience engagement using two sequential mediation mechanisms of relatability and trust. Data were obtained using a cross-sectional study design from 273 millennial users of Instagram. Our results justify the direct and indirect hypothesized relationship through Process Macros. We found that relatability and trust play a significant role in building a strong relationship between storytelling content and audience engagement. Ultimately, the research findings suggest that professionals should be more creative while making the content on Instagram to engage the millennial market. Moreover, this research has tried to fill the gap in the literature on Instagram “stories” as an advertising platform. © 2022 by the authors."

However, few studies have investigated the communicative patterns in which Twitter users participate discursively in vaccine discussions. Objectives This study aims to investigate 1) the major topics that emerged from public conversation on Twitter concerning vaccines for COVID-19, 2) the topics that were emphasized in tweets with either positive or negative sentiment toward a COVID-19 vaccine, and 3) the type of online accounts in which tweets with either positive or negative sentiment were more likely to circulate. Methods We randomly extracted a total of 349,979 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets from the initial period of the pandemic. Out of 64,216 unique tweets, a total of 23,133 (36.03%) tweets were classified as positive and 14,051 (21.88%) as negative toward a COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted Structural Topic Modeling and Network Analysis to reveal the distinct topical structure and connection patterns that characterize positive and negative discourse toward a COVID-19 vaccine. Results Our STM analysis revealed the most prominent topic emerged on Twitter of a COVID-19 vaccine was “other infectious diseases”, followed by “vaccine safety concerns”, and “conspiracy theory.” While the positive discourse demonstrated a broad range of topics such as “vaccine development”, “vaccine effectiveness”, and “safety test”, negative discourse was more narrowly focused on topics such as “conspiracy theory” and “safety concerns.” Beyond topical differences, positive discourse was more likely to interact with verified sources such as scientists/medical sources and the media/journalists, whereas negative discourse tended to interact with politicians and online influencers. Conclusions Positive and negative discourse was not only structured around distinct topics but also circulated within different networks. Public health communicators need to address specific topics of public concern in varying information hubs based on audience segmentation, potentially increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

Relatedness, a core construct of self-determination theory, is a primary influencer of motivation, and therefore being cut off from others has a negative impact on one's quality of life. Across diverse groups of people, social media is utilized for a variety of purposes directly related to connectedness, which implies inherent differences in how one's fear of missing out (FoMO) manifests in everyday life. This study employed the previously validated Fear of Missing Out Scale (FoMOS) with a nonclinical sample of African American and Caucasian college students in the United States, with a particular focus on validity of the measure with an African American cohort due to a lack of empirical evidence pertaining to with this demographic. Factor analyses yielded inconsistent findings from the FoMOS initial validation study, and results indicated differences in self-reported FoMO between the two racial groups. We speculate that observed group-based differences are at least partially the result of how individuals from each group understood and internalized the conceptual meaning of FoMO, supporting a hypothesis of practical differences in how anxieties related to missing out manifest. This may be due to individual or group-based differences in motivations for, or general purpose of, using social media. © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Here we revisit this topic through a study of YouTube “drama,” a hybrid genre where creators provide commentary on the scandals, scams, and feuds between YouTube celebrities. Drawing on cultural studies scholarship, and based on qualitative interviews and content analysis, we argue that YouTube drama embodies a range of cultural and moral negotiations that take place on social media platforms. We conceptualize accountability practices on YouTube as an ongoing “platform drama” in which creators engage in perpetual and highly visible power struggles with celebrities, audiences, legacy media, other creators, and YouTube itself. Within the context of this “platform drama,” structural issues and interpersonal conflicts become blurred, as do accountability practices and monetized spectacles. We analyze “cancelation” on YouTube as a ritualistic practice in which structural tensions are publicly negotiated and performed, even as accountability itself remains largely elusive. © The Author(s) 2022."

This article draws upon an analysis of a women-dominated community of anti-fans, Get Off My Internets (GOMIBLOG), to show instead how influencer hateblogs are discursive sites of gendered authenticity policing. Findings reveal that GOMI participants wage patterned accusations of duplicity across three domains where women influencers seemingly “have it all”: career, relationships, and appearance. But while antifans’ policing of “fake” femininity may purport to dismantle the artifice of social media self-enterprise, such expressions fail to advance progressive gender politics, as they target individual-level—rather than structural—inequities. © The Author(s) 2022."

In this study, we use a mixed-methods approach to examine mothers' experience of following three different types of Instagram profiles: InstaParents, i.e. influencers sharing their personal experiences with parenthood, professional profiles disseminating knowledge about parenting and child development, and a university-based profile disseminating knowledge about child socioemotional development. The participants were 270 mothers with children aged 0–6 years, who completed an online questionnaire regarding their experience and use of Instagram. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to examine associations between mothers' social comparison orientation and their experience of following the different types of profiles. Content analysis of mothers' responses to open-ended questions was used to examine how mothers were negatively affected and supported by the different profiles. Results showed that mothers with higher levels of social comparison orientation were more negatively affected by following all three types of profiles, but also more supported by following InstaParents. The content analysis suggested that mothers were negatively affected by InstaParents by making upward comparisons and supported by making horizontal comparisons. Mothers were supported by professional profiles, including the university-based profile, by improved knowledge, but these profiles could also lead to a decreased sense of parenting competence.

These so-called digital opinion leaders may exert a powerful impact on their followers’ political attitudes. Accordingly, we explore new directions to explain how influencers’ communication is related to political outcomes by proposing the concept of perceived simplification of politics (PSP). We argue that PSP may fuel political cynicism but also stimulate youth's interest in politics. We also explore important boundary conditions of these associations. We use data from three studies, a two-wave panel survey of adolescents (NT2 = 294), a cross-sectional survey of young adults (N = 632), and a two-wave panel survey of young adults (NT2 = 496) in Germany between 2019 and 2020. Findings of all three studies show that the frequency of exposure to social media influencers’ content increases PSP. In Studies 1 and 2, PSP is related to higher political cynicism, while in Study 3, this relationship is restricted to influencers’ communication about environmental topics and gender equality. Furthermore, Studies 2 and 3 suggest that PSP also increases political interest—yet this association requires a certain level of parasocial interaction (PSI) with the influencer and is contingent on specific political topics. © The Author(s) 2022."

It is therefore of vital importance to practitioners to understand better under what conditions a larger number of followers can trigger more positive responses in consumers than a smaller number and vice versa. Through a laboratory study, the authors recorded simultaneously eye-tracking and electroencephalogram data from 109 participants to test the research question with a 2 (type of influencer: micro vs. meso) × 2 (argument quality: weak vs. strong) between-subject design using mediated moderated linear regression analysis. The results highlight that the photo of the influencer using the product attracts more attention (i.e., fixation percentage) in the weak (vs. strong) argument quality only for micro- and not for meso-influencers. Moreover, we found a statistically significant index of moderated mediation through the level of attention, which suggests that the percentage of fixations on the photo mediates the joint effect of influencer type and argument quality on behavioral activation system (BAS). Specifically, we found that when the advertising post presents weak argument quality the enhanced attention to the photo of the micro-influencer leads to an increase in the BAS, with possible implications on advertising effectiveness and online message design.

Securing our future requires protecting plant biodiversity and the development of climate-resilient crops. Activities fostering public appreciation of plant science, and promoting plant-related professions, are therefore critical. These efforts can be hindered by plant awareness disparity, manifesting as difficulty in recognizing the presence and importance of plants. However, interest in plants as a hobby and as lifestyle elements has rapidly increased in younger demographics over the last decade. We suggest these topics should be exploited urgently by researchers and educators to increase further the reach of science communication, thereby enhancing societal awareness of botany and stimulating interest in plant-related degrees and career pathways. Summary: Plants are the basis of life on Earth as we know it and the study of plants is essential to protect our future. Yet botany and plant science are in crisis and suffer a low uptake at the level of undergraduate degrees. Increasing science communication about exciting advances in our knowledge of plants and their importance to society may be a strategy to counteract this. Here, we comment on the recent trends in the public perception of plants and explore them using infoveillance tools. Our observations highlight that paradoxically over the last decade public interest in plant-related topics has increased considerably, with the advent of a new type of social media influencer—‘plantfluencers’. Additionally, recent studies demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted awareness of the therapeutic value of interacting with plants and their positive effect on human well-being. We suggest that this offers a window of opportunity to develop an appreciation of plant science among the wider public, who are reconnecting with plants in new ways. Plant-focused communities and online groups on social media platforms can facilitate engagement with new audiences. In particular, trends relating to houseplants, plant-based diets and the benefits of interacting with plants on mental health and well-being together provide an attractive springboard for science outreach and botany-focused conversations.

Growing up in this information landscape, younger generations have developed news-related practices and attitudes that lie in stark contrast to those of previous generations. In addition, discrepancies exist between news definitions and the use practices of young people. We conducted focus groups with German adolescents (15–17 years), young adults (18–24 years) and adults (40–53 years) in August 2020 to uncover young peoples’ orientation toward news and journalism. Our study indicates that the boundaries of what journalism is and what it is not are becoming increasingly indistinct. However, distinctions do emerge between the journalistic and non-journalistic sources that adolescents and young adults use and the functions they associate with them according to their information needs. Differences between the age groups become apparent in their motivations to stay informed which highlights the important role non-journalistic sources play in information behaviour and opinion formation. For teenage participants especially, Social Media Influencers (SMIs) are relevant within these processes, which are linked to a perceived social duty-to-keep-informed. Moreover, findings from the focus groups highlight cohort-specific differences regarding the understanding of journalism and, consequently, differences in the assessment of trust and reliability as well as the verification strategies that are applied. In sum, for young participants journalism is a reliable source of information, especially in the case of current events and for crosschecking online information, while non-journalistic sources fulfil social needs. © The Author(s) 2022."

This scoping review aimed to determine how social media influencers (SMI) communicate nutrition information and the factors that influence the popularity of messages. Identified factors could inform how governments may utilise social media to impact positively on food choices. Methods: Nine databases were searched in the past 5 years (2016-2021). After relevant sources were identified, entire texts of the grey literature and the “Results” sections of the academic literature were coded. Using Microsoft Word, each key feature of the relevant text was highlighted, and the relevant code was recorded. Inductive coding was utilised where codes were created based on the text itself. These codes were then sorted iteratively into relevant themes and subthemes. Results: Eleven studies were included. From these sources, five themes were identified. These were, (i) promoting dietary change, (ii) certain modes/styles of content delivery, (iii) an attractive individual, (iv) language features and (v) appearing connected to the audience. Conclusion: SMI are selective in their content and communication techniques to ensure their nutrition messages are popular with social media users. These methods exhibited by SMI could inform strategies to build trust in government messages about food and nutrition. © 2021 Australian Health Promotion Association."

Video modification had a positive effect on expertise, but no effect on trustworthiness. Self-disclosure had a surprisingly negative effect on trustworthiness. Sponsorship disclosure only had an effect on perceived sponsorship. However, modification and sponsorship disclosure interacted, so that modification boosted both expertise and trust when videos were unsponsored. Finally, expertise mediated effects of modification on attitudes, and trustworthiness mediated effects of self-disclosure. Findings illustrate distinct roles for expertise, trustworthiness, and sponsorship perceptions in the influencer context. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH. All rights reserved."

Over the last few years, influencers have emerged as a relevant endorser for CSR messages, but there is a lack of research investigating their effectiveness. Hence, the purpose of the study is to analyze how the type of source and message framing on social media influence message credibility, corporate reputation (CR) and word-of-mouth (WOM). Design/methodology/approach: An online experiment with 2 (source: influencer vs corporate) × 2 (CSR frame motives: values-driven vs performance-driven) between-subject design was conducted among 200 participants. Findings: Results showed that the type of source does not affect message credibility or CR but a corporate source generates more WOM. Moreover, values-driven motives increase CR and generate more WOM. However, the type of frame motives does not impact message credibility. Originality/value: The current paper tests the effect of framing and source when communicating CSR on social media. The paper shows that overall an effective CSR communication should be posted by a corporate source and framed by values-driven motives. Hence, the study contributes to the contemporary literature regarding CSR communication and provides practical implications for companies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

It is also centrally tied to who engages it - it can be driven by openly sectarian social media accounts, or through subtle nudges by influential accounts, allowing for complex means of reinforcing vilification of marginalized groups, an increasingly significant problem in the media environment in the Global South. We identify dangerous speech by influential accounts on Twitter in India around three key events, examining both the language and networks of messaging that condones or actively promotes violence against vulnerable groups. We characterize dangerous speech users by assigning Danger Amplification Belief scores and show that dangerous users are more active on Twitter as compared to other users as well as most influential in the network, in terms of a larger following as well as volume of verified accounts. We find that dangerous users have a more polarized viewership, suggesting that their audience is more susceptible to incitement. Using a mix of network centrality measures and qualitative analysis, we find that most dangerous accounts tend to either be in mass media related occupations or allied with low-ranking, right-leaning politicians, and act as ""broadcasters""in the network, where they are best positioned to spearhead the rapid dissemination of dangerous speech across the platform. © 2022 ACM."

Design/methodology/approach: Across two empirical studies, the authors examine the efficacy of AI social media influencers. With Study 1, the authors establish baseline effects for AI influencers and investigate how social-psychological distance impacts consumer perceptions. The authors also investigate the role of an influencer’s agency – being autonomous or externally managed – to test the boundaries of the results and determine the interactive effects between influencer type and influencer agency. Study 2 acts as an extension and validation of Study 1, whereby the authors provide generalisability and overlay the role of need for uniqueness as a moderated mediator. Findings: The authors show that there are similarities and differences in the ways in which consumers view AI and human influencers. Importantly, the authors find no difference in terms of intention to follow or personalisation. This suggests that consumers are equally open to follow an AI or human influencer, and they perceive the level of personalisation provided by either influencer type as similar. Furthermore, while an AI influencer is generally perceived as having lower source trust, they are more likely to evoke word-of-mouth intentions. In understanding these effects, the authors show that social distance mediates the relationship between influencer type and the outcomes the authors investigate. Results also show that AI influencers can have a greater effect on consumers who have a high need for uniqueness. Finally, the authors find that a lack of influencer agency has a detrimental effect. Research limitations/implications: The studies investigate consumers’ general response to AI influencers within the context of Instagram, however, future research might examine consumers’ response to posts promoting specific products across a variety of category contexts and within different social media platforms. Practical implications: The authors find that in some ways, an AI influencer can be as effective as a human influencer. Indeed, the authors suggest that there may be a spill-over effect from consumer experiences with other AI recommendation systems, meaning that consumers are open to AI influencer recommendations. However, the authors find consistent evidence that AI influencers are trusted less than traditional influencers, hence the authors caution brands from rushing to replace human influencers with their AI counterparts. Originality/value: This paper offers novel insight into the increasingly prominent phenomenon of the AI influencer. Specifically, it takes initial steps towards developing understanding as to how consumers respond to AI influencers and contrast these effects with human influencers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

One of the initial observations was that the data trail was very limited, which made it impossible to quantify the value, if any, it was having on the business. In response to this discovery, the organisation formalised a workflow to tighten its influencer marketing efforts. Since then, Bang & Olufsen has taken a far more effective approach to working with influencers across local markets, developing guidelines as well as more stringent review and reporting processes.

Through a survey in which over 5,000 participants provided open-ended reference group associations for 25 major brands, the authors find that social media influencers can either strengthen or change brand reference group associations. Specifically, the typicality of the influencer (relative to a brand's stereotypical consumer) can shape ideas about the perceived homogeneity of the brand's consumers, which ultimately influences the strength and tightness of brand associations. This research combines seminal theories regarding cultural and sociological influences on branding, concepts relating to stereotype change, and a multi-method approach to assess new digital flows of cultural meaning from consumer influencers to brands. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Most previous research on influencer marketing has concentrated on its effectiveness as a promotional tool. In contrast, there have been limited studies on the influencer-social media user relationship. The relationship that influencers have with other social media users is the foundation for the success of influencer marketing. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the factors that affect the influencers’ relationships with other users. In accordance with the concept of information relevance, this study presents a model relating the various attributes of influencer-generated content with emotional attachment and information quality to examine the relationship between influencers and other social media users. The findings of a survey of 280 respondents indicate that the interestingness, novelty, reliability, and understandability of influencer-generated content can effectively increase users’ emotional attachment to influencers. Reliability and understandability can also have a significant positive impact on information quality. This eventually inclines social media users to follow or recommend influencers to others, which can increase the popularity of influencers. This study helps researchers and marketers advance their understanding of influencers’ relationships with other social media users and offers management-related recommendations for influencers and marketers. © 2022 by the authors.

People are tending to use the Internet, and social media especially, more frequently and for a wider variety of purposes. In parallel, a number of cultural spaces have already decided to invest in marketing and message spreading through the web and the media. Growing their audience, or locating the appropriate group of people to share their information, remains a tedious task within the chaotic environment of the Internet. The investment is mainly financial—usually large—and directed to advertisements. Still, there is much space for research and investment in analytics that can provide evidence considering the spreading of the word and finding groups of people interested in specific information or trending topics and influencers. In this paper, we present a part of a national project that aims to perform an analysis of Twitter’s trending topics. The main scope of the analysis is to provide a basic ordering on the topics based on their “importance”. Based on this, we clarify how cultural institutions can benefit from such an analysis in order to empower their online presence. Copyright: © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

TikTok videos with large cigar and Swisher Sweets-related hashtags between July 2016 and September 2020 were analyzed. Follower count was used to identify influencers. We compared content characteristics and demographics of featured individuals between cigar types, and by influencer status. We also examined the association between content characteristics and video engagement. Compared to large cigar videos, Swisher Sweets videos were more likely to feature arts and crafts with cigar packages, cannabis use, and flavored products. In addition, Swisher Sweets videos were also more likely to feature females, Black individuals, and younger individuals. Both Swisher Sweets and large cigar influencers posted more videos of cigar purchasing behaviors than non-influencers, which was associated with more video views. None of the videos disclosed sponsorship with #ad or #sponsored. Videos containing the use of cigar packages for arts and crafts, and flavored products highlight the importance of colorful packaging and flavors in the appeal of Swisher Sweets cigars, lending support for plain packaging requirements and the prohibition of flavors in cigar products to decrease the appeal of cigars. The presence and broad reach of cigar promotions on TikTok requires stricter enforcement of anti-tobacco promotion policies. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

These improvements have deeply affected various disciplines of sciences and consequently changed services such as daily business, particularly health sectors. Innovative digital marketing strategies utilize the channels of social media and retrieved user data to analyze and improve relevant services. These multidisciplinary innovations can assist specialists, physicians and researchers in diagnostic, prophylaxis and treatment issues in the health sector. Accordingly, compared to recent decades, health decision makers are more accurate and trustful in defining new strategies. Interestingly, using social media and mobile health apps in current pandemics of SARS-CoV-2 could be an important instance of the key role of these platforms at the local and global level of health policies. These digital technologies provide platforms to connect public health sectors and health politicians for communicating and spreading relevant information. Adding influencers and campaigns to this toolbox strengthens the implementation of public health programs. In 2016, the WHO adopted a global program to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030. Recent constructive measures that have been used in the battle against COVID-19 could be adopted for the elimination of viral hepatitis program. The presented evidence in our narrative review demonstrates that the application of digital marketing tools to create campaigns on social media, armed with professional influencers, can efficiently consolidate this program. The application of different strategies in using these popular tools will raise the public awareness about viral hepatitis. Subsequently, the availability of an effective vaccine for HBV and antiviral medication for HCV can motivate the audience to take steps towards prophylaxis and screening methods against these infectious illnesses. The encouragement of health policy makers to apply digital communication technologies and comprehensive roadmaps to implement this global program will certainly decrease the burden of viral hepatitis worldwide. © 2022 by the authors.

Research has found that exposure to social media images depicting thin, muscular bodies, often dubbed ‘fitspiration’, may contribute to body dissatisfaction. Image-centred social media platforms, such as Instagram, have rising popularity among adolescents and young adults. However, little is known about the content of images produced by different fitness-related sources, such as those from fitness brands compared with individual users, and how fitness content on social media is evolving over time. This study sought to determine whether Instagram content varied between female fitness influencers and brands and how this content changed between 2019 and 2021. A longitudinal content analysis was conducted on a sample of 400 Instagram images using a coding scheme developed specifically for this project. The scheme coded images for fit ideal body depiction, fitness focus, objectification, and sexualisation. Chi-square tests indicated that female fitness influencer content was more sexualised and portrayed more of the fit ideal, while fitness brands produced more Instagram content with a fitness focus. There were no significant overall longitudinal changes for any of the four key variables. However, when looking at longitudinal changes by account type, fitness-focused influencer content increased while fitness-focused brand content decreased over time. These findings highlight discernible differences in content produced by different Instagram account types. It points future research towards the consideration of potential moderating factors, such as account type, when exploring the impact of social media images on body image and mental health. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework to improve the state of the art in micro-influencer ranking based on multimedia content. Moreover, since the visual congruence between a brand and influencer has been shown to be a good measure of compatibility, we provide an effective visual method for interpreting our model's decisions, which can also be used to inform brands' media strategies. We compare with the current state of the art on a recently constructed public dataset and we show significant improvement both in terms of accuracy and model complexity.

Research Question: How has online communication about advance care planning (ACP) and specific life-sustaining interventions (LSIs) changed during the pandemic? Study Design and Methods: Conversations on Twitter containing references to LSIs (eg, “ECMO”) or ACP (eg, “DNR/DNI”) were collected between January 2019 and May 2021. User account metadata were used to predict user demographic information and to classify users as organizations, individuals, clinicians, or influencers. The number of impressions was compared across these user categories and the content of tweets analyzed by using natural language processing models to identify topics of discussion and associated emotional sentiment. Results: There were 202,585 unique tweets about LSIs and 67,162 unique tweets about ACP. Users who were younger, male, or influencers were more likely to discuss LSIs online. Tweets about LSIs were associated with more positive emotional sentiment scores than tweets about ACP (LSIs, 0.3; ACP, –0.2; P < .001). Among tweets about ACP, most contained personal experiences related to the death of loved ones (27%) or discussed discrimination through do-not-resuscitate orders directed at the elderly and disabled (19%). Personal experiences had the greatest retweet-to-tweet-ratio (4.7), indicating high levels of user engagement. Tweets about discrimination contained the most negative net sentiment score (–0.5). Interpretation: The observed increase in tweets regarding LSIs and ACP suggests that Twitter was consistently used to discuss treatment modalities and preferences related to intensive care during the pandemic. Future interventions to increase online engagement with ACP may consider leveraging influencers and personal stories. Finally, we identified do-not-resuscitate-related discrimination as a commonly held public fear, which should be further explored as a barrier to ACP completion and can be proactively addressed by clinicians during bedside goals-of-care discussions. © 2022 American College of Chest Physicians"

It uses thematic analysis to identify discursive tactics that protect viewers’ face. The article argues that the parasocial nature of the connection that these videos attempt to establish with an audience that content creators know little about makes it important for them to reflexively adapt to these viewers’ needs for fellowship and autonomy. Their disclosures may be intended to create closeness, but at the same time they need to cater for distance and prepare the ground for this content to be received as well as possible. However, just like the connection that the videos seek to establish, the facework they contain is also parasocially situated: the videos speak to an imagined viewer’s need for inclusion and this viewer’s possible objections, as these are perceived by the content creator. The article contributes to a better understanding of the construction of closeness in this genre of mediated discourse. © The Author(s) 2022."

First, it sets out to compare consumer acceptance of lab-grown meat in the U.S. and in Singapore. Second, it seeks to explain the difference in Americans' and Singaporeans' acceptance of lab-grown meat by examining their eating motivations. Specifically, we focused on social image motivations – the motivations to present oneself positively in social contexts. Third, this study also aims to assess if exposure to information about lab-grown meat communicated by celebrity versus expert social media influencers (SMIs) can impact people's acceptance of lab-grown meat products. Our analysis showed that Singaporean participants had greater acceptance of lab-grown meat compared to their American counterparts, and this cultural difference was explained by Singaporeans' stronger social image eating motivations. In other words, cross-country differences in motivation to eat for a favorable social image can explain differences in consumer acceptance of lab-grown meat. The Singaporean cultural trait of kiasuism, which is exemplified by the fear of losing out or being left behind, may explain Singaporeans' motivation to project an image of being ‘trailblazers’ (vis-a-vis other nationalities) by expressing a higher acceptance of novel foods such as lab-grown meat. Results also revealed that the information about lab-grown meat being communicated by a celebrity or an expert SMI did not make a difference in participants' acceptance of lab-grown meat in both countries. Together, this research suggests an interesting implication that novel food industries and marketers can promote product branding by boosting media coverage (including online social media) of their lab-grown products' ‘firsts’ (e.g., the first production line in the world, the first technological breakthrough), especially in markets with high social image concerns. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

To address both problems, three new realistic diffusion models are proposed, based on the Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models, namely IC-u, LT-u and UAD models. This study was implemented using Instagram data. Meanwhile, UAD model uses two thresholds, namely user's awareness, and user's tendency. These models incorporate user's activeness and engagement factors that represent the susceptibility to influence and the degree of influence, respectively. The proposed models were proven to be up to 2.72x more realistic and produced more engaging and more active users. The seeds set (influencers) identified by the IM algorithms under the proposed models are expected to have more impact on an actual brand marketing campaign if compared to existing models. © 2020 The Authors"

Among such actors are public debaters who establish themselves as professional opinion-makers and media personalities via ‘media provocations’. In this article, we develop a conceptual framework for studying how these media provocateurs emerge as influential personas in journalism. Whereas previous research has provided important insights into how similar non-traditional actors have challenged journalism from a sociological perspective, we adopt a rhetorical perspective on the phenomenon and describe how the provocateurs’ public persona constructions evolve in a sequential, cumulative, and transformative communicative process that cuts across different rhetorical situations in a hybrid media system. The proposed framework points to several future avenues of research into how non-traditional actors, such as media provocateurs, (micro-)bloggers, and social media influencers, may reflect the current state and direction of journalism. © The Author(s) 2020."

Furthermore, existing research does not recognize the group decision-making nature and the possibility of customer involvement in celebrity or influencer selection for social media marketing. This study conceptualizes celebrity selection as a multi-attribute group decision-making problem while deriving the final ranking of celebrities/influencers using interactive and flexible criteria based on the value tradeoff approach. The article thus proposes and demonstrates a quantitative objective method of celebrity selection for a brand or campaign in an interactive manner incorporating customer's preferences as well. Design/methodology/approach: Each decision-maker's preferences for celebrity selection criteria are objectively captured and converted into an overall group preference using a modified generalized fuzzy evaluation method (MGFEM). The final ranking of celebrities is then derived from an interactive and criteria-based value tradeoff approach using the flexible and interactive tradeoff method. Findings: The approach gives a different ranking of celebrities for two campaigns based on group members' perceived importance of the selection criteria in different scenarios. This group includes decision-makers (DMs) from the brand, marketing communication agency and brand's customers. Further, each group member has an almost equal say in the decision-making based on fuzzy evaluation and an interactive and flexible value tradeoff approach to celebrity selection for receiving a rank order. Research limitations/implications: The approach uses secondary data on celebrities and hypothetical scenarios. Comparison with other methods is difficult, as no other study proposes a multi-criteria group decision-making approach to celebrity selection especially in a social media context. Practical implications: This approach can help DMs make more informed, objective and effective decisions on celebrity selection for their brands or campaigns. It recognizes that there are multiple stakeholders, including the end customers, each of whose views is objectively considered in the aspects of group decision-making through a fuzzy evaluation method. Further, this study provides a selection mechanism for a given context of endorsement by objectively and interactively encapsulating stakeholder preferences. Originality/value: This robust and holistic approach to celebrity selection can help DMs objectively make consensual decisions with partial or complete information. This quantitative approach contributes to the literature on selection mechanisms of influencers, celebrities, social media opinion leaders etc. by providing a methodological aid that encompasses aspects of interactive group decision-making for a given context. Moreover, this method is useful to DMs and stakeholders in understanding and incorporating the effect of nature or context of the brand and the campaign type in the selection of a celebrity or an influencer. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

As vaccines have been developed under expedited conditions, their safety and efficacy are being questioned by some populations leading to vaccine hesitancy, resulting in delayed vaccine uptake and herd immunity. This study aims to adopt a combination of Health Belief Model and other independent risk factors associated with high vaccine acceptance. Methods: An anonymized cross-sectional survey was distributed between 15 January and 3 February 2021 across Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia among adult respondents through a certified online panel. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were carried out to assess perception constructs followed by multivariate regression modelling to assess factors associated with high vaccine acceptance against SARS_CoV-2. Results: A total of 3,133 anonymised participants from Singapore (n = 1,009), Australia (n = 1,118) and Hong Kong (n = 1,006) completed the survey. While age and gender were not significantly associated, Asian ethnicity, current smokers and self-efficacy were significant associated factors of increased vaccine acceptance. While specific practices like taking micronutrients more frequently, cleaning and disinfecting their house more often were positively associated with increased vaccine acceptance, seeking medical help for COVID-19 symptoms like loss of smell/taste and overall COVID-19 knowledge score were negatively associated. Increased likelihood of vaccine acceptance was seen among those that obtained COVID-19 information less frequently and used digital media or non-health-related sources like influencers as a source of information. Among the eight perception constructs, perceived susceptibility and perceived response efficacy were positively associated, while perceived barriers were negatively associated with high vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: While demographic parameters have weak association with vaccine acceptance, perceptions and practices parameters can help to better understand and influence vaccine acceptance. Study findings should provide guidance on the risk communication strategy to enhance vaccine acceptance for vaccination and boosters against new SARS-CoV-2 variants. © 2022 The Author(s)"

Design/methodology/approach: The study applies a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data were obtained by analyzing Instagram content with samples for analysis being taken from company-related posts from June 2018 to June 2020. Qualitative data collection was by two focus group discussions (FGD). The FGDs comprised in total, 22 employee influencers representing the 11 sectors of SOEs in Indonesia. Findings: The article examines how employee influencers engage with others; how they are chosen by their organizations; how they are managed and the support they need from their employers. It was discovered that a careful triangulation is required between employees as influencers, their followers and SOE communication hubs. A key factor is maintaining the authentic relationship between employee influencers and their followers. A conceptual model of employee influencer management for Indonesia is proposed. Research limitations/implications: The research provides useful insights for communication management, marketing, and human resources in developing and supporting the role of employee influencers. Practical implications: The research provides useful insights for communication management, marketing and human resources in developing and supporting the role of employee influencers. The suggested model is of practical utility for SOEs for managing employee influencers in Indonesia and provides valuable indicators for other countries. Originality/value: The study of SOEs’ employee influencers has not been explored previously in the literature. This, combined with the Indonesian perspective, brings new insights to the field. Social media use is especially high in Indonesia, so it acts as a good exemplar for the field. It also builds on the growing literature about the importance of employees as influencer, especially in the social media space.

To better understand teachers’ use of this social media platform, we examined the Instagram accounts of 12 highly popular and influential pre-K–6 teachers (i.e., teacher influencers). Data sources comprised over 600 visual and textual posts, which included images, captions, hashtags, and emojis, produced over 3 months in the spring of 2019. Using qualitative coding procedures that were recursive and emphasized the emergent nature of interpretation through a critical literacies framework, we documented the neoliberal teachers’ use of Instagram as a method of participation in a virtual community of practice and as a way to produce, commodify, and possibly profit from posts presented as curricula. Findings suggest that teacher influencers primarily used Instagram as a form of commodification and commerce, as educational content was promoted to users as well as methods of purchase via personal websites, Teachers Pay Teachers and other digital stores. Overall, the teacher influencers’ Instagram use revealed a convergence of complex and multiple discourses involving curriculum, racialized and/or gendered identities, and neoliberal production. © The Author(s) 2022."

The field of reference will be that of identity-related images on social networks, because compared to other kinds of images, such as artistic or professional ones, they adopt new compositional solutions and new dynamics of circulation. To test this theoretical framework, we will conduct an analysis which has never been carried out in semiotics and which, as far as we know, remains very rare even in the overall field of visual studies, that is, the analysis of the profile of an Instagram influencer's visual production, that of Canadian artist Rupi Kaur. Taking into account the flow of images shared over time, we will focus primarily on the compositional dimension that articulates the specificity of the language of images. The most appropriate model for investigating social network photos seems to be that of the portrait, thanks to which we will identify a first series of regularities and deviations. Secondly, we will turn towards the rhetorical dimension - the persuasive strategies found within, through, and towards images - focusing on the analysis of a single photo: on the one hand, it is a shot which presents greater compositional richness than others; on the other hand, it has greatly impacted the notoriety of the influencer, due to the censorship incurred on Instagram, its abundant coverage by traditional media, and the heated debate it triggered on social media. We will thus propose a reinterpretation of Paul Ricœur's theory of identity in order to balance the rhetorical and the compositional dimensions through a unitary theoretical hypothesis. Visual identity on social networks is always the result of a negotiation between two opposite tendencies: on the one hand, the experiential pressure expressed through images related to the body and everyday practices; on the other, the algorithmic pressure due to the delegation of the management of identity to software. The case of Rupi Kaur is a rare example of a critical mediation between these two pressures and helps us build a methodology for the examination of images belonging to other social domains. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

Firms sometimes pay influencers to skew their product reviews in favor of the firm. We ask the following research questions. First, what is the optimal level of affiliation (if any) from the firm’s perspective? Affiliation introduces positive bias to the influencer’s review but also decreases the persuasiveness of the review. Second, because affiliated reviews are often biased in favor of the firm, what is the impact of affiliation on consumer wel-fare? We find that the affiliation decision depends on the cost of information acquisition, the consumer’s prior and awareness, and the disclosure regime. When the consumer’s prior belief is low, the firm needs to affiliate less closely or not at all in order to preserve the influ-encer’s persuasiveness, the change in the consumer’s belief following the influencer’s review. In contrast, when the consumer’s prior belief is high, the firm fully affiliates with the influencer to both maximize awareness and prevent a negative review. We also show that the firm’s involvement can be Pareto improving if the information acquisition cost is relatively high, and a partial disclosure rule may increase consumer welfare. © 2021, INFORMS."

This systematic literature review aims to explore the role of SM in children's and adolescents' diets and related behaviors, considering also the underlying mechanisms. We searched Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL (2008-December 2021) for studies assessing the relation of SM exposure with food intake, food preference, dietary behaviors, and the underlying mechanisms (e.g., brain activation to digital food images - as proxy for SM food images) among healthy children and adolescents aged 2-18 y. A total of 35 articles were included. Of 4 studies, 1 found that exposure to peers' videos on healthy eating, but not SM influencers', increased vegetable intake. Most studies reported that SM was associated with skipping breakfast, increased intake of unhealthy snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages, and lower fruit and vegetable intake, independent of age. Children and adolescents exposed to unhealthy compared with healthy digital food images showed increased brain response in reward- and attention-related regions. The mechanisms underpinning the abovementioned associations were 1) physiological (appetitive state, increased neural response to portion size and energy density of food depicted) and 2) social (food advertising via SM influencers and peers). SM exposure leads to unfavorable eating patterns both in children and adolescents. The identified mechanisms may help tailor future health interventions. Downregulating SM advertising and limiting SM exposure to children and adolescents may improve food intake and subsequent health outcomes.

To deal with the large volume of extreme opinions, companies, and PR authorities spent heavily on soothing the tension and sheltering customer word-of-mouth from devasting reviews by feeding public overloaded information, dominating public attention and grabbing new headlines, yet very few studies rationalize this assumption. This paper develops simulation experiments to unmask the aforementioned relations, in particular, how information environment (i.e., information preference and noise), individual factors (i.e., acceptance threshold, halo effect), and institutional efforts (i.e., promotion) affect the customer review's evolution at the aggregate level. The findings suggest that the evolution of opinion in divergence can occur in any preference-held audience whereas the information noise can substantially moderate the information valence and cause the polarized voices to get mild dramatically. In addition, a halo effect on the information source can stir the voice to be amplified by the influencer. The experimental results indicate the significance of understanding information valence and group conformity in conversational contexts and find a few clues of improving communication effects. This research bears high originality in explaining how public opinions evolve in a belief-neutral environment via audience-sensitive, context-bound, objective-manipulated techniques.

It can be difficult for consumers to know whether the influencers they are following are real. To combat this, social media sites introduced user verification. Verification, denoted by a blue checkmark badge visible in search and on one's profile, is ostensibly a way of confirming one's identity, yet only accounts with large followings are awarded verification status by the platform. In this paper, we investigate the perception of verification in the context of SMIs, a topic relatively absent from the literature despite the billions of dollars spent on partnerships. Specifically, we investigate if consumers perceive verification as more directly associated with credibility or celebrity. Further, we consider whether the fit of the influencer with the advertisement yields discrepancies in consumers' trust of the advertisement and endorser in paid partnerships on social media. Through two studies, we find that consumers associate verification most closely with celebrity, rather than authenticity and that when the influencer is advertising a product that does not fit with their brand, consumers are significantly less likely to trust verified accounts rather than unverified accounts. This study has theoretical implications for marketing researchers as well as practical implications for marketing managers. Verified influencers cost more; therefore, this research provides unique insights for brands to capitalize their ad return if they are made aware of the implications associated with verification. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

However, few studies have explored how social media influencers, and more broadly, consumers, actively integrate resources to engage in service innovation in social commerce. This qualitative study (involving two firms and their influencers) examines the emerging roles of social media influencers and their resource integration behaviors in service innovation. Drawing on the service-dominant logic and the technology affordance theory, the study advances a framework that identifies the resource integration behaviors that underlie two primary roles of influencers—communicator and innovator—and explains how social media technology affordances facilitate these behaviors, and thereby, the ensuing innovation outcomes. By focusing on the technology-mediated processes of social media influencers’ engagement in service innovation, we contribute to research and practice in consumer-led service innovation in the emerging digital world. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Consequently, online game live-streamers have played an important role in the business industry (e.g., advertisements) as well as the online video game industry. By focusing on this context, this study identifies streamer attributes and live-streaming mobile application attributes, and examines how each attribute influences spectators’ flow experience, psychological well-being, commitment, and loyalty toward their favorite streamer. Based on the cognitive appraisal theory and social media influencer literature, the authors classify streamer attributes (i.e., friendship, interaction, and streamer skills) and live-streaming mobile application attributes (i.e., perceived usefulness, technology & functional quality, convenience, and security quality) in the context of Twitch. The data were collected from Twitch users in the United States via two waves. The empirical findings indicated: (1) friendship, technology & functional quality, convenience, and security quality significantly affected flow experience; (2) friendship, streamer skills, convenience, and security quality significantly influenced psychological well-being; (3) flow experience significantly impacted commitment and loyalty; (4) psychological well-being had a significant effect on commitment; and (5) commitment significantly affected loyalty. The empirical findings of this study provide meaningful implications to scholars and practitioners in the social media and online video game contexts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Therefore, building on extant endorsement research and the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), the study examines how the use of tattoos impacts SMI's credibility, attractiveness, and effectiveness. Based on a sample of 260 young adults, a 2 x 2 x 2 (SMI gender x tattoo x domain) experimental design was conducted. Results indicate a tattoo premium effect, regardless of SMI's domain.

Although PHNs provide vital services to protect communities and populations’ health, a pervasive lack of knowledge exists regarding the PHN role among policymakers and the general public. Advocacy for investment in the public health nursing workforce remains a priority as staffing and financial constraints have created sizeable barriers for PHNs during the COVID-19 response. Creating an advocacy video with personal stories from PHNs emerges as a powerful and cost-effective strategy to increase the visibility of PHNs. For this project, interviews with PHNs from COVID-19 hot spots were used to create a 3-min advocacy video. PHNs featured in this video discussed the implications of rerouting resources to combat COVID-19 for the populations they serve. The authors disseminated the video through popular social media venues, public health and nursing organizations and nurse influencers to reach nursing students, faculty, and the public. Over an 8-week period, the video received 2732 views on social media with an average view duration of 2 min.

We focus on ‘Mrs Hinch’; aka Sophie Hinchliffe from Essex, the ‘homegrown’ Instagram star with 4.1 million followers who shares daily images and stories of cleaning and family life, and has a series of bestselling books, regular daytime TV appearances and supermarket tie-ins. We argue that, within neoliberal culture, housework is now often refashioned as a form of therapy for women’s stressful lives: stresses that neoliberalism and patriarchy have both generated and compounded. The argument is developed through three sections. First, we locate Mrs Hinch in relation to longer classed, gendered and racialized histories of domestic labour and the figure of the ‘housewife’, and the re-writing of domestic narratives to find new ways of ensuring women’s willingness to participate in unpaid domestic labour. Second, we analyse the contradictions of cleanfluencing as a form of ‘digital identity labour’ representing offline housework, which in this case is precarious and classed. Finally, drawing these themes together, we show how ‘Hinching’ recasts housework as part of a neoliberal therapeutic promise to ‘clean away’ the instabilities, anxieties and threats of contemporary culture. © The Author(s) 2021."

Aussi nous avons mené une étude prospective sur la ligamentoplastie du ligament croisé antérieur afin: (1) d'analyser les moyens par lesquels les patients avaient connu leur chirurgien, (2) d'identifier les facteurs ayant pu influencer le choix final du chirurgien. Hypothèse: Le choix de son chirurgien par le patient est influencé par les notes sur les réseaux sociaux et les classements dans la presse. Matériel et méthode: Une étude prospective a été menée, incluant de manière continue l'ensemble des patients opérés, sans référentiel de technique, dans trois établissements différents, privés et publics. Un questionnaire anonyme sur les critères de choix noté de 0 à 10 était donné sur volontariat le jour de la programmation de l'intervention par le chirurgien. Résultats: Cent cinq patients ont été inclus. Les futurs opérés étaient amenés à connaître leur praticien par le biais d'avis de proches ou du médecin traitant pour plus de 2/3 d'entre eux. Le critère essentiel du choix final du chirurgien était la clarté de l'information écrite et orale en consultation (moyenne = 8,09/10 ± 1,83). Étaient notés ensuite les délais avant chirurgie (7,39/10 ± 2,25) et avant la première consultation (7,26/10 ± 2,01) ainsi que la réputation du chirurgien (7,42/10 ± 2,43). Conclusion: Le « bouche à oreille » et la qualité de l'information apportée en consultation semblent être la base du choix final du chirurgien, plus que l'influence des réseaux sociaux et des classements des hôpitaux rapportés par les journaux.

The present study investigates the effectiveness of SMIs by examining the role that two message factors—argument quality and sponsorship status—have on travelers’ perceptions of a hotel’s commitment to sustainability and their intention to stay at the hotel. Results from four studies show that when eco-friendly hotels sponsor SMIs, an attribute-value message is more effective than a simple recommendation message in influencing travelers’ perceptions and intentions. Given the latest Federal Trade Commission regulations regarding sponsorship disclosure practices, the findings offer valuable insights for tourism providers using SMIs.

This study surveyed a sample of 7,015 adult female TikTok users in China regarding their social media influencer viewing frequency, self-objectification, social comparison tendencies when watching short videos, intentions to change appearance, and demographics. The results showed that female TikTok users’ self-objectification mediated the association between their influencer viewing frequency and their intentions to change appearance. Furthermore, social comparison tendencies moderated the association between influencer viewing and intentions to change appearance in that the proposed association was stronger for female TikTok users who had lower social comparison tendencies when watching short videos, compared to female TikTok users who had higher social comparison tendencies. The counter-intuitive finding on social comparison tendencies indicated that women who have higher social comparison tendencies may be more aware of the negative influences and adjust their expectations. The observed association between social media influencer viewing and intentions to change appearance was statistically significant but trivial in terms of effect size.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample amounts to 101 responding companies, obtained from the SABI database. The companies belong to the service sector in Spain and have at least 50 employees and 5 years or more of existence in the market. The model was estimated through partial least squares structural equation modeling with smartPLS software 3.2.6. Findings: The results show that the use of social media is very important for firms to acquire knowledge and capabilities that help them to become S-D oriented. In addition, absorptive capacity and unlearning processes are dynamic capabilities necessary to transform the knowledge acquired in social media and to become S-D oriented. Research limitations/implications: Companies’ managers draw conclusions that can generate great value, while better meeting the needs and desires of the market, the more knowledge is obtained.

Further, drawing upon source credibility theory and contemporary theories of persuasion, the Instagram users’ perceptions of the influencer’s credibility are predicted to mediate the hypothesized effects. Design/methodology/approach: Through an online (N = 192) and a lab study (N = 112), the authors examined Instagram users’ responses to an advertising post from Instagram influencers in terms of perceived source credibility and electronic word-of-mouth intention, using validated multi-item scales from existing literatures and electroencephalogram (EEG) measures. The hypotheses were tested with a 2 (type of influencer: micro vs meso) × 2 (argument quality: weak vs strong) between-subject design using mediated moderated linear regression analysis. Findings: The results highlight that meso-influencers are perceived as a credible source of information only when their product-related post provides strong argument quality. Moreover, this process involves an increase in users’ cognitive work (measured with EEG), with possible implications on marketing communication strategies and online message design. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of the work can serve as ideas for future research. First, this study did not account for the influencer’s relevance and resonance. Second, the authors studied consumer responses to online communication produced by Instagram influencers within a single product category. Another important product type distinction that requires further attention is between hedonic and utilitarian products. Finally, the two studies only used positive review content. Further research should study how consumers evaluate the source credibility of a micro- vs meso-influencer when they are exposed to negative reviews containing weak vs strong arguments. Practical implications: The results suggest that marketers should carefully consider Instagram influencers based on the trade-offs between credibility and reach. Specifically, micro-influencers are perceived as more credible sources of information than meso-influencers, which means that they have greater potential to affect Instagram users’ behavior. Moreover, the results suggest that meso-influencers should leverage argument quality to enhance their credibility and draw greater positive outcomes for the products and brands they endorse. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to investigate how the interaction between the type of social media influencer and the argument quality affects consumers’ self-reported and brain responses to advertising posts on Instagram.

In particular, we investigated whether tweens’ healthy food choice behavior can be stimulated by using a thin-ideal influencer in a sponsored influencer post promoting unhealthy vs. healthy food. A two-by-two, between-subjects experimental study (influencer weight: thin-ideal vs. overweight; snack-type: unhealthy vs. healthy) was conducted with 146 tweens (11–13 years old, 73 boys). Results show that tweens’ choice for a healthy snack was higher when a (female) overweight influencer promoted an unhealthy snack (compared to a healthy snack). Using a thin-ideal influencer promoting an unhealthy vs. healthy snack did not affect tweens’ healthy food choices. While there were no interaction effects of influencer weight and snack type on source effects (influencer credibility, influencer admiration, and trans-parasocial interactions), the results did show that the influencer was perceived as less credible and was admired less when she was overweight vs. when she had a thin-ideal body-type.

Secondly, the factors considered by consumers while making a final decision for purchasing and traveling are explored, affected by the destination image for the country of origin. The aim of the research was fulfilled by reviewing relevant literature and defining and exploring the relationship among variables: vlog marketing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, E-WOMs, consumer travel intent, consumer purchase intent, destination image, and ease of travel. A self-administered survey questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale was utilized and shared online among social media users for collecting data via two resources: personal connections and relevant social media platforms. A total of 428 valid responses were collected. The PLS-SEM software was used to analyze and interpret the data. The measurement model, structural model, regression analysis, and t-tests were used for testing and concluding results for hypotheses. The results concluded that vlog marketing, with all its higher-order constructs, except Snapchat, has a significant positive effect on consumer travel intent and purchase intent. Moreover, destination image and ease of travel enhance the relationship of vlog marketing and consumer travel intention but not that of vlog marketing and consumer purchase intention. The study contributes to the literature on influencer and content marketing on social media networks by emphasizing the role of vloggers in shaping consumer behavior and placing a distinct image of a destination place, and how ease of travel affects the decision to travel and buy travel goods and services advertised on vlogs. © The Author(s) 2022."

On social media, semi-PSIs are real but imbalanced exchanges with audiences, including through comments on influencers' videos, and strong semi-PSIs are those that occur within PSRs. This article introduces and assesses an automatic method to detect videos with strong PSI potential. Design/methodology/approach: Strong semi-PSIs were hypothesized to occur when commenters used a variant of the pronoun ""you"", typically addressing the influencer. Comments on the videos of UK female influencer channels were used to test whether the proportion of you pronoun comments could be an automated indicator of strong PSI potential, and to find factors associating with the strong PSI potential of influencer videos. The highest and lowest strong PSI potential videos for 117 influencers were classified with content analysis for strong PSI potential and evidence of factors that might elicit PSIs. Findings: The you pronoun proportion was effective at indicating video strong PSI potential, the first automated method to detect any type of PSI. Gazing at the camera, head and shoulders framing, discussing personal issues, and focusing on the influencer associated with higher strong PSI potential for influencer videos. New social media factors found include requesting feedback and discussing the channel itself. Research limitations: Only one country, genre and social media platform was analysed. Practical implications: The method can be used to automatically detect YouTube videos with strong PSI potential, helping influencers to monitor their performance.

A new generation of social media influencers has recently emerged in the Muslim world. They are western-educated, unique storytellers, and savvy in digital media production. This raises new questions on the future of Islam in the context of emerging challenges, such as the openness of technology and the often-perceived closedness of religious and cultural systems within Muslim societies. This paper uses a multiple case research design to examine the roles of social media influencers in reimagining Islam and reshaping spiritual beliefs and religious practices among young people in the Gulf Region, the Arab world, and beyond. We used thematic analysis of the Instagram and YouTube content of four social media influencers in the Gulf Region: Salama Mohamed and Khalid Al Ameri from the United Arab Emirates, Ahmad Al-Shugairi from Saudi Arabia, and Omar Farooq from Bahrain.

This demand businesses that are in the tourism and hospitality sector to advertise their destination more creatively and informatively, such as using a travel influencer. The present research was conducted to explore how the public adopts information advertised by a social media influencer that promotes travel or leisure places, better known as a travel influencer. The Information Adoption Model (IAM) was used to explore the factors that could affect people’s perception of Information Usefulness (IU), which then affects Information Adoption (IA). Several hypotheses that were built from the IAM theoretical framework were tested using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) with 150 people as respondents; four out of the seven hypotheses were accepted.

During a pandemic/epidemic (e.g., coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic), an overabundance of information from many sources, including social media, has led to what is now termed as an 'infodemic'. Infodemics arise from overwhelming amounts of both correct and incorrect information from experts and nonexperts alike. Differentiating correct from incorrect information is difficult for social media users who can be swayed by nonscientific 'influencers' or fear-mongering more than by vetted expert scientific information. Consequently, vaccine misinformation is steadily increasing via social media, the use of which is often believed to be associated with vaccine hesitancy. Stopping the spread of misinformation has been a difficult task.SummaryVaccine misinformation on social media has been detrimental to public health.

Pennsylvania has the third highest number of drug overdose deaths per year, with the COVID-19 pandemic worsening these trends. Stigmatising beliefs towards OUD are associated with negative health outcomes, and there is a need for a larger evidence base on OUD stigma reduction strategies. This study reports on the creation and implementation of Life Unites Us, a digital media campaign which uses a collective impact framework to address OUD stigma reduction across Pennsylvania. Method: Life Unites Us consists of various components, including a general public media campaign which uses education and contact-based strategies; engagement with stakeholders and advocates in community-based organisations across the state; and a data sharing website to inform the public of previously unavailable OUD stigma statistics. Each campaign component contributes to the overall collective impact framework. Results: Digital metrics showed 755 followers across the Life Unites Us social media pages, and 2,826 total website users with an average of 565 users per month. The campaign has partnered with 60 community based organisations, 921 individuals receive the monthly email and 11 influencers have posted 23 times and achieved over 13,000 engagements and a reach of 661,000. The campaign hosted 5 webinars with 520 attendees and an overall 64.1% attendance rate. Conclusion: This study fills a gap in the need for evidence-based digital interventions to address OUD-related stigma. The positive process metrics from the first 6 months suggest that this model may be an important addition to research on approaches to reduce OUD stigma. © The Author(s) 2022."

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital technologies applications continue to emerge to enhance and improve novel ways of communication on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Indeed, this has caused a change in the behavioral and social customer journey, where customers need to embrace a digital experience adoption. The AI applications primarily aim to study the shoppers browsing trend to draw new clients and expand businesses. Even the fashion industry has tapped into Instagram's business benefits in this fast-paced and competitive industry. With this quick and compelling way to capture shoppers’ attention towards fashion products, the purchase decision may differ between e-shoppers and conventional shoppers. AI seems to be extremely promising and has the potential to be a game changer for Instagram users, advertisers, and influencers. This study applies the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) theory to investigate the effects of AI-based digital technology experiences on Instagrammers’ fashion apparel purchase decisions - perceived eWOM, perceived emotional value, perceived quality, perceived risk and perceived price. Based on data collected from Instagram users, the framework of this study was evaluated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Semi-structured in-depth interviews were also conducted as part of the research to get a more in-depth understanding of the profiles and behaviors of Instagram users. Our findings from both methodologies confirm that perceived emotional value, perceived quality, and perceived eWOM revealed a statistically significant and positive influence on Instagrammers’ purchase decisions for fashion apparel. Meanwhile, the importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified perceived emotional value as the most important factor for Instagrammers, but the highest performance was perceived quality. This research has important implications for Malaysian online retailers and shoppers to adapt to the fast-changing digital transformation. Assuredly, this study makes a noteworthy contribution to attitudinal research on social media commerce within the fashion industry. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

More specifically, we investigate the impact of emotions and authority on sharing, as well as the moderating role of political extremity of social media users. We analyzed 10,141 political tweets, sent by 527 influencers between July 2019 and June 2020. The results reveal that content in which emotions are more prevalent than argument quality is more likely to be shared than content in which argument quality is prevalent. Perhaps surprisingly, we also show that content in which positive emotions are more prevalent than negative emotions is more likely to be shared than content in which negative emotions are prevalent. Moreover, authority (i.e., a dominant language style and a high number of followers) can lead to increased shares. Finally, we find that content in which positive emotions are more prevalent than negative emotions is less effective in increasing shares when users are located at the ideological extreme compared to the ideological center. On the one hand, we provide insights into how influencers in social media networks can be utilized for political campaigning. On the other hand, we provide insights into what makes users engage with political content from influencers that might contribute to political polarization on social media. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

However, little is known about differences in social media use among physicians of varying specialties and its impact on recruitment of trainees. Our objective was to describe differences in social media use among vascular interventional proceduralists at academic training institutions. Methods: We identified institutions with training programs in vascular surgery (VS), interventional radiology (IR), and interventional cardiology (IC). Faculty providers were identified in each specialty at these institutions. A standardized search was used to identify non-anonymous social media profiles on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter in September 2019. Influencers were defined as physicians with more than 1,000 Twitter followers. Follow ratio was defined as the number of followers divided by the number of accounts followed. Between-specialty differences were analyzed. Results: A total of 1,330 providers (n = 454 VS, n=451 IR, n = 425 IC) were identified across 47 institutions in 27 states. Across all physicians, a minority of providers utilize social media (Facebook: 24.9%, n = 331; Instagram: 10.8%, n = 143; Twitter: 18.0%, n = 240). VS were significantly more likely to use Instagram (P = 0.001) but there was not a significant difference in utilization of Facebook and Twitter. Among Twitter users, VS had fewer followers on average (median 178, inter-quartile range [IQR] 39-555) than IR (median 272, IQR 50-793, P = 0.26) and IC (median 286, IQR 71-1257, P = 0.052). IC were most likely to be influencers (30.9%, n = 25) followed by IR (17.9%, n = 15) and VS (10.7%, n = 8, P = 0.006). On average, interventional cardiologists had the highest follow ratio (mean 4.9 ± 7.1) compared to interventional radiologists (mean 3.2 ± 5.5) and vascular surgeons (mean 2.5 ± 3.3, P < 0.001). Conclusion: A minority of academic vascular interventional proceduralists utilize social media in a non-anonymous manner. On Twitter, interventional cardiologists are most likely to be influencers based on number of followers and, on average, have the highest follow ratio. Vascular surgeons could potentially benefit from pursuing greater influence and visibility on social media as a means to recruit trainees. © 2021"

Focusing on disposable surgical masks in particular, this article examines consumer perceptions of and intentions toward social media influencers who wear such masks amid the pandemic. Drawing on the theory of product symbolism, this research experimentally demonstrates that masked (vs. unmasked) influencers remind consumers of highly competent healthcare professionals, leading in turn to greater competence inferences about and more favorable behavioral intentions toward these influencers. Additional analysis demonstrates that this effect might not hold for other groups of professionals who are considered relatively competent at the outset and/or whose profession is less reliant on external cues. Overall, this research suggests that apart from curtailing the spread of the pandemic, mask wearing might prove beneficial to certain groups of professionals, such as social media influencers, who have traditionally struggled to establish credibility.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyzed four influential Portuguese fashion blogs regarding eight fashion brands that had experienced a corporate crisis situation. In total, five of the selected brands were mentioned in 2.846 posts of blog content, whose discourse was deeply analyzed. Findings: The absence of express reference to brand crisis suggests that fashion bloggers tend to ignore these crisis events or divert the readers' attention to the brands' more positive aspects. This result opens the discussion whether fashion bloggers downplay corporate crisis in brand equity or whether it expresses strategies of brand crisis communication through digital influencers. Originality/value: Though social media may be a source of negative word-of-mouth, social media influencers have been considered important partners of corporate crisis communication in particularly challenging times. Many studies have focused on the role of social media influencers in crisis management, but there was a dearth of research on the specific case of blogs. This study contributes to the understanding of fashion bloggers as agents of brand communication, particularly regarding crisis management and their role on brand activation and positive electronic word-of-mouth, even under crisis situations.

The following research questions were designed to guide this study: How does social media communication unfold over the course of an emergency at a cultural event? How does the nature and purpose of social media communication between all SM users change once an emergency occurs that affects event operations? How does the sentiment of social media communication change once an emergency occurs that affects event operations? Design/methodology/approach: This study explored how social media was used to communicate about on-site emergencies at community cultural events. Three events were studied before, during and after an on-site emergency that disrupted the event.

Once an emergency is underway, communication increases and who is talking with whom changes. The nature and purpose of the social media conversation also evolves over the course of an emergency. Research limitations/implications: This study examined the social media communication during three on-site emergencies at three different cultural events. The findings contribute to the understanding of the Social Media Crisis Communication Model. Specifically, the research confirms the various actors who engage online but also shows that two-way communication is not common. As this study only examined three events experiencing three different emergencies, we have a limited understanding of how the type of emergencies affects social media communication. Practical implications: The findings show the need for pre-crisis work by event organizers. It is necessary for the events to build trust with their online communities to ensure that when an emergency occurs the event will be seen as a trusted source. Also, staff training is needed to ensure people are prepared to handle the complexities of communicating online during an emergency. Issues like misinformation, influencers and the rapid pace of social media communication create a challenging environment for staff who are unprepared. Originality/value: Emergencies can threaten the survival of event organizations and put the health and wellness of attendees, staff and other stakeholders at risk. The study of crisis communication in special event contexts has received little theoretical attention and yet it is an important area of event management practice. Social media is an essential part of communication strategies and should be integrated into emergency planning to best reach people when an emergency threatens the safety of those involved with the event. The Social Media Crisis Communication Model offers some insight, but understanding its relevance is necessary if it is to be integrated into event emergency management. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Political speech enjoys the highest degree of protection by national constitutions as well as supranational and international charters. Unlike commercial speech which usuallyenjoy less constitutional protection, political speech is the foundation of constitutional democracies. The blurring line between political and commercial speech introduces a new layer of complexity in tackling hidden political advertising. Indeed, political speech is likely to attract commercial speech inside a broader scope of protection with the result that potential limitations of this kind of speech would be required to pass a very strict test through the balance with other constitutional safeguards or legitimate interests according to the criteria of necessity, legitimacy and proportionality. This could also question the scope of other regulation designed to govern commercial speech like advertising. To this end, the paper compares regulatory and judicial interpretations adopted in Europe and the United States, and is structured as follows. In the first part, we explore the content monetization business models (including influencer marketing) used on social media, and we identify three types of influencer ‘personas’ who are prone to engage in political speech. The second part looks into the constitutional differences between commercial and political speech across the Atlantic. The third part provides the normative argument at the intersection between consumer law and freedom of expression, and the fourth part concludes. © The Author(s) 2022.

Design/methodology/approach: For this research, micro celebrities of Pakistan have been defined as the target population. Secondary data consisting of 464 tweets from walls of six micro celebrities belonging to both genders and diverse set of socio-political fields was collected. Tweedie estimation analysis was run to accept or reject the hypotheses. Mean values with standard deviations were utilized to analyze the different engagement patterns of dichotomous variables (content type, content language, mentions, hashtags, text, images, links, videos, hour of the day and day of the week) on online engagement. Findings: Content type, content language, content length, hashtags, mentions, images, links, videos, hour of the day and day of the week have been found to have a significant relationship with online engagement on Twitter. Research limitations/implications: First, the study has been conducted in context of micro celebrities on Twitter. It did not include influencers on other social media networks. Second, study considered only quantitative aspects of engagement based on secondary data ignoring qualitative aspects of phenomenon due to time and methodology constraints. Third, study did not include link clicks as a measure of engagement as clicks data is not publicly available on the posts. Practical implications: The study contributes significantly to find out valuable “micro celebrity” strategies in Pakistan. The study suggests micro celebrities to tweet soft content in Urdu language along with relevant hashtags and mentions to get higher engagement on their tweets. Further, tweets should contain maximum number of characters. Micro celebrities should not insert images, links and videos in their tweets as these media types result in lower engagement on Twitter. Micro celebrities should tweet at low hours and weekends. Social implications: As this study focuses on investigation of better engagement practices for micro celebrities, it will help general public to express themselves more effectively through social media. Originality/value: First, this is the first study that investigates the online engagement model for micro celebrities. Second, the online engagement model designed in this study has yet not been investigated to best of our knowledge. The theoretical model combines multiple engagement factors discussed in previous studies conducted on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

A number of “digital influencers” perform a fitness lifestyle, producing subjectivities entangled with an idea of success and “well managing oneself.” However, as happiness is constructed as a mandatory “individual engineering project,” more recently, female influencers have emerged who go against standards of beauty taken as oppressive. They embrace other physiques as forms of self-expression and finding joy, mostly the “big” body. Both forms of self-construction are appropriated by consumer culture and are perceived as authentic, reinforcing individualistic agency in a neoliberal context. But what happens when a fitness influencer accidently leaks the information that she underwent a liposuction procedure? Or when a “body positive” model is criticized for appropriating a plus-size agenda and not having a “true” plus-size body? Based on two Brazilian cases and literature review, this article proposes the notion of “gendered ruptures of performances,” which reveal expressive incoherence in the “narratives of the self,” thus breaking ideals of authenticity. It is argued that little attention has been paid to female self-presentation dynamics that do not occur as expected. Moreover, since their bodies are constantly subjected to the scrutiny of others, they are more susceptible to having their performances invalidated online. © 2022 Duke University Press."

While patients may benefit in various ways from these interactions, little is known about the types of endometriosis-related information published on social media. As digital opinion leaders influence the perceptions of their followers, physicians need to be aware about ideas and beliefs that are available online, in order to address possible misconceptions and provide optimal patient care. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify and analyze frequent endometriosis-related discussion topics on social media in order to offer caregivers insight into commonly discussed subject matter and aspects. Methods: We performed a systematic search using predefined parameters. Using the term ""endometriosis"" in Facebook's search function and a social media search engine, a list of Facebook pages was generated. A list of Instagram accounts was generated using the terms ""endometriosis"" and ""endo"" in Instagram's search function. Pages and accounts in English with 5000 or more followers or likes were included. Nonpublic, unrelated, or inactive pages and accounts were excluded. For each account, the most recent 10 posts were identified and categorized by two independent examiners using qualitative content analysis. User engagement was calculated using the numbers of interactions (ie, shares, likes, and comments) for each post, stratified by the number of followers. Results: A total of 39 Facebook pages and 43 Instagram accounts with approximately 1.4 million followers were identified. Hospitals and medical centers made up 15% (6/39) of the Facebook pages and 5% (2/43) of the Instagram accounts. Top accounts had up to 111,600 (Facebook) and 41,400 (Instagram) followers. A total of 820 posts were analyzed. On Facebook, most posts were categorized as ""awareness"" (101/390, 25.9% of posts), ""education and research"" (71/390, 18.2%), and ""promotion"" (64/390, 16.4%). On Instagram, the top categories were ""inspiration and support"" (120/430, 27.9% of posts), ""awareness"" (72/430, 16.7%), and ""personal story"" (72/430, 16.7%). The frequency of most categories differed significantly between platforms. User engagement was higher on Instagram than on Facebook (3.20% vs 0.97% of followers per post). On Instagram, the highest percentage of users engaged with posts categorized as ""humor"" (mean 4.19%, SD 4.53%), ""personal story"" (mean 3.02%, SD 4.95%), and ""inspiration and support"" (mean 2.83%, SD 3.08%). On Facebook, posts in the categories ""awareness"" (mean 2.05%, SD 15.56%), ""humor"" (mean 0.91%, SD 1.07%), and ""inspiration and support"" (mean 0.56%, SD 1.37%) induced the most user engagement. Posts made by hospitals and medical centers generated higher user engagement than posts by regular accounts on Facebook (mean 1.44%, SD 1.11% vs mean 0.88%, SD 2.71% of followers per post) and Instagram (mean 3.33%, SD 1.21% vs mean 3.19%, SD 2.52% of followers per post). Conclusions: Facebook and Instagram are widely used to share endometriosis-related information among a large number of users. Most posts offer inspiration or support, spread awareness about the disease, or cover personal issues. Followers mostly engage with posts with a humoristic, supportive, and awareness-generating nature. Health care providers should be aware about the topics discussed online, as this may lead to an increased understanding of the needs and demands of digitally proficient patients with endometriosis. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

Individuals’ consumption decisions tend to be greatly influenced by the people that surround them, and this seems to be especially true when it comes to food. In recent years, alongside close contacts, such as family and friends, a myriad of social influencers have appeared on the screens, sharing opinions on what (not) to eat. Presenting results from a youth survey conducted in Sweden in 2019 (N = 443), this paper shows that social media have become the primary source of information about food and eating for youths, followed by schools and families. However, primary sources of influence continue to be parents and the family at large. Furthermore, the study shows that it is possible to identify ‘central persons’, i.e., relatively clear-cut groups of people whose food choices—measured as tendency to eat climate friendly—is mirrored by the youths, both in their everyday food preferences and in their broader political awareness as expressed through political consumerism. A conclusion from this is that certain people can be particularly successful at inspiring larger numbers of other people to engage with healthier and environmentally friendlier (food) consumption in a society. © 2022 by the author.

Due to consumers' negative perceptions of pharmaceutical companies, it makes sense that new marketing tactics are being used to establish and improve relationships with consumers. Previous research well documents the ethical dilemmas of direct-to-consumer advertising, and there is recent burgeoning literature on online covert marketing tactics. The academic and medical literature, however, is behind in regard to social media influencers used in health and medicine.

The information quality of videos related to the two most performed aesthetic procedures - botulinum toxin type A (Botox) and soft-tissue filler injections - has not been assessed or compared to that of websites. Methods: A YouTube search for ""Botox"" and ""fillers"" was performed in July of 2020, identifying the most popular health information videos. Quality was assessed using the validated Journal of American Medical Association, Health on the Net principles, and the DISCERN criteria in addition to a procedure-specific content score. Quality scores were compared between different groups of video contributors and against websites. Results: A total of 720 measurements of quality were performed across 95 YouTube videos and 85 websites. The mean quality scores were as follows: Journal of the American Medical Association, 1.74/4 ± 0.718; Health on the Net, 6.66/16 ± 2.07; DISCERN, 40.0/80 ± 9.25; and content, 39.1/100 ± 11.9.

Vaccinating is an effective means of addressing the pandemic threat. The government of India has implemented a massive vaccination drive to save its citizens from the deadly virus. However, the effort has faced multiple challenges, including vaccine hesitancy. This research understands respondents’ perspectives on factors contributing to the lower vaccination uptake in Gujarat, India. Forty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted through convenience sampling representing different demographic backgrounds. Factors influencing vaccine adoption included religious leadership, political leadership and the government, and fear of side effects, especially among children and those with co-morbidities, resulting primarily from fake news and misinformation circulated through social media. Compared with nine countries from across the world, the study found similarities to vaccine hesitancy from misinformation and the fear of side effects among children. In contrast, the role of government and the influence of religious and political leaders was considered positive. The study recommends strategies to overcome people’s apprehensions about the adoption of vaccination. These include offering incentives, providing positive peer-to-peer communication, recruiting influencers such as religious and community leaders and early adopters such as the elderly population to endorse vaccination, targeting youth through social media, and reaching rural sections by involving NGOs and social service groups. © 2022 by the authors.

The imposed government lockdowns and quarantine periods saw an increase in social media influencers delivering their own home-based exercise programmes, but these are unlikely to be an evidence-based, efficacious, long-term solution to tackle sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity. This rapid review aims to conceptualise home-based exercise and physical activity programmes, by extracting relevant programme characteristics regarding the availability of evidence and effectiveness of home-based exercise programmes. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, of which there were varied reports of significant positive effects of the exercise programme on weight management and related outcomes. The two most common measures were Body Mass Index and body mass, as of which almost all reported a trend of post intervention reduction. Some programmes reported qualitative data, identifying barriers to physical activity and preferred programme components, highlighting a need to consider factors outside of physiological measures. The findings provide guidance and direction for the development of future home-based physical activity and exercise programmes for adults living with overweight and obesity. © 2022"

An online survey was distributed through social media, yielding 544 international respondents with information on sociodemographics, values, main barriers, motivation and influence towards meatless lifestyle choice. An open question gathered qualitative data on how participants overcame perceived barriers to meatless eating. The larger influencer was scientific research (19.1%) and as their main motive animal welfare (49.1%). Reported adherence factors were related to people (as family, friends, partners, community), research and recipes. Age, dietary lifestyle (vegetarian, pescatarian) are positive predictors of adherence. Living in EU, skills and hardship barriers and own perception of barriers are negatively associated to long term adherence to a meatless diet.

Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted using an online survey, and data was collected using Amazon MTurk. The respondents were asked to think of an online reviewing channel that they watch regularly and subsequently responded to a series of questions. The analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling via AMOS. Findings: Both channel interactivity and vloggers’ self-disclosure displayed a positive impact on consumers’ parasocial interaction with vloggers, which eventually led to perceived trustworthiness, brand identification, communal–brand connection with the channel, purchase intention toward the recommended products and willingness to pay a premium price for extra services. Research limitations/implications: Future research can examine the robustness of the findings by using a sample of internet users who are similar in terms of frequency, enthusiasm and duration of active usage.

We found that French and English Twitter users who are interested in this topic did not usually interact. While top English Twitter influencers were professors, top French influencers were government officers and individuals. Clusters of Twitter members interested in occupational safety had a low tendency to reach people in other groups. Most failed to make good use of weak ties to increase their impact and shared information about occupational safety outside their circle of friends. This overthrows previous research that Twitter's social network was built based on the weak tie: Twitter users follow commentators, celebrities, and opinion leaders who do not know personally. Besides, we also conducted sentiment analysis via machine learning algorithms. We found that the more positive sentiment of an English Tweets, the more likely it will be retweeted. Yet, the more negative sentiment of a French Tweets, the more likely the Tweets will be retweeted. Thus, negative occupational safety Tweets have stronger impacts than positive ones among French but not English Tweets. While sentiment analysis results of French Tweets indicated that most Twitter users discussed occupational safety issues with a neutral tone, the number of extreme negative in French Tweets was a lot more than that of English.

In recent years, changes in how women are presented and addressed in marketing, including alcohol marketing, have been observed. This reflects the shifting social, political and regulatory context, in which increased attention has been given to gender inequality and the damaging impact of gender stereotypes. Research is yet to explore the gendered nature of alcohol marketing within this contemporary context. Methods: A quantitative content and qualitative thematic analysis of alcohol marketing posts (N = 2600) by 20 alcohol brands on Facebook and Instagram pages over an 18 month period (1st January 2019–30th June 2020) was conducted. Marketing strategies were identified, and the way in which posts targeted, represented and engaged women analysed. Findings: New (e.g. ‘influencer’ collaborations) and established (e.g. competitions) strategies were being used to target both women and men. Drinking was presented as a feminine practice and as an important component of ‘doing’ a combination of traditional, post-feminist and feminist femininities. Women were assigned a range of gender roles that acknowledged their individual pleasures and achievements, and traditional gender roles and stereotypes were both reinforced and rejected to promote alcohol use. An important move away from sexualising and demeaning women to the appropriation of feminist and equality messages was observed, which may appeal to a wider range of women, including those embracing feminist identities. Conclusion: Alcohol brand marketing encourages alcohol use to women through both perpetuating and challenging gender stereotypes. Claims by brands of a commitment to equality are at odds with the harms related to alcohol consumption that contribute to the widening of health and social inequalities. It is important that future work on women's drinking and alcohol marketing is situated within the shifting social-political climate in which traditional, post-feminist and new fourth wave feminist rhetoric and femininities co-exist. © 2021"

In this case, we find such tension between former, more Confucian roles of motherhood, related to duty and knowing one's place, and a more recently arrived influence of neoliberalism. On the one hand, the hashtags provide a sense of community for stay-at-home mothers who have given up their careers, but on the other, the influencers configure this duty and obligation into something based on striving, individual success and self-management.

However, the potential of this segment has been underrated by both marketers and marketing scholars. The empirical belief of senior consumers' technological illiteracy somewhat discourages industrial and academic approaches to seeking the answer to some critical questions such as what older consumers think about social media-based advertising, influencers, or peer communications. Thus, this study aims to explore and explain older consumers' social media-related behaviour through (a) delving into motives behind their frequently used social media site(s), (b) investigating older consumers' purchase behaviour aspects (i.e., determinant(s) to purchase decisions, favoured shopping modes), (c) discovering what senior consumers think about social media-based advertising, influencers, and peer communications, and (d) evaluating the impact of social media on older consumers' purchase behaviour. Five key themes emerging from the adopted qualitative approach are (1) Facebook predominance, (2) Scepticism, (3) Price sensitivity, (4) Asymmetric social influences, and (5) Favoured physical store shopping. Each finding is demonstrated in a detailed causal explanation. Academic contributions and implications for social media marketers are highlighted and discussed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Recently, a number of social media influencers have video logged about their experiences of cervical screening through narrative communication with their audience. Here we aimed to explore if accessing cervical screening information from a social media influencer can impact the theory of planned behaviour variables and predict intention to attend cervical screening appointments. Design: Utilising a cross-sectional design a volunteer sample of 102 UK women (mean age = 28; SD = 3.10; range = 25–35) took part in an online questionnaire study. Results: Hierarchical regression modelling revealed attitude as a significant predictor of intention to attend a cervical screening appointment and that social media influencers affect attitudes of their audience, indirectly influencing intention to attend. Conclusion: Health messages communicated by social media influencers are effective in promoting positive attitudes but not directly influence intention to attend towards cervical screening. Further research should explore influencer impact on attitudes towards this health behaviour with the ultimate aim of increasing attendance and consequently saving lives. © The Author(s) 2022."

Thus, companies have an interest in engaging opinion leaders to post about products and brands, and the authors analyse different incentives for encouraging them to spread the word on social media (via electronic word-of-mouth [e-WoM]). Design/methodology/approach: A 2 × 3 between-subjects experimental design was developed in which 359 technological opinion leaders (bloggers) participated. The authors manipulated the monetary incentive (money vs no money) and non-monetary incentives (information only vs return product vs keep product) offered in exchange for a brand post. Findings: Various techniques for approaching opinion leaders are effective, but to differing degrees. Providing a product free of charge increases the likelihood that opinion leaders will post about it, and the highest intention to post is observed when they are allowed to keep the product. In contrast, giving money to opinion leaders could have an indirect negative impact on their intention to post through the expected negative reaction of followers. Originality/value: It remains unclear how opinion leaders can best be encouraged to spread e-WoM, as incentives used for consumers may work differently for opinion leaders, who have followers that they want to maintain. The main contribution of this paper lies in its explanation of why opinion leaders react differently to monetary versus non-monetary incentives. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach - The research question is examined using Convenience sampling which is a type of non-probability sampling technique. Respondents filled the online questionnaire between November 2020 to October 2021. The data were collected through online questionnaires which were circulated through Google forms on various social networking sites to a sample of 500 respondents, out of which 300 responses were valid. Structured questionnaires are used in this study to collect quantitative data. Statistical analysis, such as correlation and regression through SPSS Statistics, have been used to obtain the relationship between variables. Findings - Key findings indicates the ability of the influencers who are open to new experiences and extraverts are likely to share positive WOM which ultimately leads to consumer buying decisions. Emotions like excitement also create awareness among people to share positive WOM. Excited influencers tend to try and buy new brands leading to recommending the consumers. Research limitations- There is a need to extend the results to large sample size and diverse range of cultures. Practical implications - The influencers on various social media platforms should build up confidence among people by conducting various activities and making them feel connected with a particular brand or product. They should try to create excitement by suitable designs in their products. Word of mouth will reduce the marketing expenses of a company. © 2022 University of Stockholm. All rights reserved."

Using their own social media channels, influencers often give the impression that they have a personal rather than a commercial relationship with the brand and the products they promote. Therefore, when influencers post sponsored content, consumers often experience difficulty making accurate distinctions as to whether the influencer is offering a personal recommendation or doing a promotion. Given this issue, we examine to what extent sponsored posts of different influencer types affect consumers’ evaluations of the sponsoring brand and the influencer as well as what role the sponsorship disclosure plays therein. Across four experimental studies, we demonstrate that sponsored posts of mega influencers increase consumers’ persuasion knowledge relative to the posts of nano influencers, which decreases the trustworthiness of those posts and in turn negatively impact both brand and influencer evaluations. Interestingly, our results reveal that this indirect effect is only present when the sponsorship is not disclosed. Thus, more transparency by disclosing such sponsorship can eliminate the negative impacts of persuasion knowledge on the trustworthiness of posts and subsequent evaluations of the brand and the influencer. These findings have important implications for marketing practice and research. © 2022 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE."

Body dysmorphic disorder is often found in adolescents who fail to achieve developmental tasks. This study examines the relationship between the intensity of Instagram usage and the tendency of body dysmorphic disorder in female students. Methods: This study uses a cross-sectional correlational design. The population was active students of the Faculty of Nursing, Universitas Padjadjaran, aged 18-24 years (N=712), by total sampling with a response rate of 75% (n=539). This study used Instagram User Intensity questionnaires and Body Dysmorphic Tendency questionnaires. The data were analysed using SPSS.25 with the Spearman rho test. Results: There was a significant relationship between the intensity of Instagram use and body dysmorphic tendencies with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.099 and a significance level of p = 0.022 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, the more intense the use of Instagram, the higher potential for body dysmorphic tendencies. The results are expected to assist nurses in preventing or overcoming negative perceptions of patients regarding body image that allows for body dysmorphic disorder by encouraging patients to reduce the intensity of using Instagram. © 2022 UPM Press.

More specifically, this study conceptually identified social media influencer attributes such as language similarity, interest similarity, interaction frequency, and self-disclosure and examined the respective effects of each dimension on perceived friendship and psychological well-being, consequently resulting in loyalty toward social media influencers. The authors collected and analyzed data from 388 social media users in the United States via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk with multivariate analyses to test the hypothesized associations among the variables in this study. The findings indicated that perceived friendship was significantly influenced by language similarity, interest similarity, and self-disclosure, but did not have a significant impact on psychological well-being. Additionally, perceived friendship significantly affected psychological well-being and loyalty, and psychological well-being significantly influenced loyalty. Lastly, social media influencers’ social responsibility moderated the path from psychological well-being to loyalty. Based on these findings, this study proposes theoretical and managerial implications for the social media influencer marketing context. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Idealized body images shared on the platform have been associated with lower levels of body satisfaction in this population, likely due to social comparison processes. In the present study, we tested a mediation model linking Instagram use (i.e., browsing through others’ profiles, commenting on others’ looks, posting one’s own photos or stories) to body dissatisfaction (i.e., body image discrepancy and lack of body appreciation), mediated by upward social comparison with close peers, distant peers, and social media influencers. Methods: We applied structural equation modeling to self-report cross-sectional data collected from 291 female adolescents and young women (Mage = 19.8, SD = 4.6; 94.8% Italian). Results: Our final model results show that browsing on Instagram was associated with lower levels of body appreciation, fully mediated by upward social comparison with social media influencers, not close or distant peers. Commenting on others’ looks and posting own content were not associated with body dissatisfaction. Being an adolescent female (compared to a young woman) and having a higher BMI were associated with worse body appreciation. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for public health interventions to raise awareness about the posting practices of social media influencers and to strengthen a positive body image among young females susceptible to social comparison processes. © 2022 by the authors.

Through national curfews and social distancing, individuals’ social lives changed and led to increased levels of stress and mental health problems. As another consequence, communication, especially among young people, has shifted to social networking sites, where particularly young adults sought help for their mental health problems. In recent years, Instagram has received recognition for its health-enhancing potentials. On this social networking site, more than 1 billion users worldwide post 500 million stories and images per day. Methods: During COVID-19, increasing mental health incidences were reported throughout the world, and have led mental health influencers to gain in relevance. The proposed study is based on a quantitative survey. In order to test how different content formats utilized by mental health influencers —motivational quotes, comics, or influencer posts—are evaluated by Instagram users, a cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted in April 2021. Data collection was based on convenience sampling. In total, 532 Austrian respondents between 16 and 34 years of age participated in the survey. Results: Overall, the content that received the most favorable evaluations were both the motivational quote (M = 4.23) and the influencer post (M = 4.12), while the comics scored lower in terms of evaluations (M = 3.72). Conclusions: Respondents’ preference of content suggests that individuals seek out content that boosts their esteem or content with a “human touch”. Explanations as to why the selected content formats were preferred over the other formats are offered alongside a future research outlook. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

My analysis reveals the ways in which these influencers appeal to the utopian discourses of early web culture and the underlying principles of wellness culture to build and sustain an online following. While early accounts of micro-celebrity treat participatory culture as democratising and progressive, this article demonstrates how the participatory affordances of social media have been exploited to spread misinformation, conspiratorial thinking and far-right extremism.

Potential disclosure strategies need to be tested to confirm whether users recognize such posts as commercially sponsored. Methods: Between July – August 2019, young adult (ages 16–24; n = 200) participants were recruited to view their native Instagram feed on a laboratory mobile device. Posts from e-cigarette influencers were manipulated to add either #ad or #sponsored while eye tracking software measured visual attention. Participants self-reported their interpretation of the hashtags in open-ended responses. Logistic regression analyses compared recognition of commercial content by condition, and qualitative content analyses summarized the key themes related to the hashtags. Results: The #ad condition had nearly twice the odds of commercial recognition compared to #sponsored (OR = 1.98, CI: 1.14–3.38). Every second of attention paid to the hashtag significantly increased the odds of commercial recognition by 22% (OR: 1.22, CI: 1.00–1.33). Conclusion: The #ad disclosure attracted visual attention and significantly increased recognition of commercial sponsorship from young social media users.

Through in-depth qualitative interviews with four Finnish influencer mothers and online observation of their social media accounts, the article asks how influencers negotiate the feeling rules that govern maternal femininity on social media and attempt to cope with the emotional weight of precarious social media work. The article argues for using the affective practice of anxiety as a theoretical concept to explore the influencers’ routinized emotional behaviour in their attempts to decrease the discrepancy between their emotions and cultural expectations. The article suggests that although anxiety can be considered a negative side effect of stressful social media work, sharing it on social media can also be understood as a tactic that plays a central role in the lifestyle influencer industry. Drawing on Loveday’s analysis of the ‘neurotic academic’, the article suggests that the construction of an entrepreneurial influencer self is underpinned by anxiety.

Design: Cross-sectional data were analysed across three livestreaming platforms and six food and beverage categories: alcohol, candy, energy drinks, snacks, sodas and restaurants. Setting: Stream titles of livestreamed events as well as corresponding hours watched on Twitch, Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming. Participants: None. Results: There were significant differences between the use of food and beverage brand mentions in stream titles across all three studied platforms (P < 0·05), as well as hours watched across platforms (P < 0·05). Energy drinks dominated food and beverage brand mentions across platforms, followed by restaurants, soda and snacks. All platforms demonstrated growth over the 17-month data collection period. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted both immediate and sustained growth across all platforms, with the greatest impact observed on the Twitch platform. Conclusions: Food and beverage marketing as measured through stream titles is widely prevalent across the three most popular livestreaming platforms, particularly for energy drinks. Food marketing on these platforms experienced growth over the past 17 months which was accelerated substantially by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a phenomenological perspective and following a process approach, a total of 35 semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with SMIs of different ages, follower numbers and associated with diverse areas of expertise. Subsequently, via interpretative analysis of interviewees' narratives and reasons for becoming SMIs, relevant motivations and events were uncovered and described. Findings: The findings showcase two types of SMIs: “Entrepreneurial Influencers” and “Influential Entrepreneurs”. Their motivations and the path they followed on their entrepreneurial efforts were also uncovered. Finally, based on these findings, a new entrepreneurial motivational driver is proposed.

They are gaining popularity by creating content in various areas, including fashion, music, art, sports, games, environmental sustainability, and mental health. Marketing firms and brands increasingly use them to capitalise on their millions of followers. Yet, little is known about what prompts people to engage with these digital beings. In this paper, we present our interview study with online users who followed different VIs on Instagram beyond the fashion application domain. Our findings show that the followers are attracted to VIs due to a unique mixture of visual appeal, sense of mystery, and creative storytelling that sets VI content apart from that of real human influencers. Specifically, VI content enables digital artists and content creators by removing the constraints of bodies and physical features. The followers not only perceived VIs' rising popularity in commercial industries, but also are supportive of VI involvement in non-commercial causes and campaigns. However, followers are reluctant to attribute trustworthiness to VIs in general though they display trust in limited domains, e.g., technology, music, games, and art. This research highlights VI's potential as innovative digital content, carrying influence and employing more varied creators, an appeal that could be harnessed by diverse industries and also by public interest organisations. © 2022 ACM."

With the increased use of influencer marketing, it is important for marketers to understand consumer perceptions of these modified appearances. This paper aims to use the lens of perceived morality (PM) to investigate consumer perceptions of cosmetic surgery services and the effect of enhanced body appearance on consumer interest in an endorsed brand. Interpersonal similarity (IS) is tested as a boundary condition. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach was taken with a qualitative study and two online experiments. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling (NStudy 1 = 133) and Amazon Mechanical Turk (NStudy 2 = 202; NStudy 3 = 270). Findings: The themes uncovered in the qualitative study revealed that cosmetic surgery services were acceptable when internally motivated but may signal inauthenticity. The findings of Study 2 suggested consumer interest in an endorsed brand was negatively impacted by body enhancement (BE), with PM as the underlying mechanism. Study 3 results demonstrated IS moderated this effect. The indirect effect was significant only for those low in IS. Originality/value: This research contributes to the underexplored area of cosmetic surgery services and its role in influencer marketing. The findings extend the literature on consumer attitudes and perceptions toward these services and provides insight into the intersection of BE and morality. The contribution is notable, as marketers increasing rely on social media influencers, many of whom have undergone cosmetic surgery services and enhanced their body appearance, to promote their brands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In doing so, the authors contribute to theorising of aesthetic and emotional labour within the services marketing literature, fleshing out the bodywork of influential others not as employees but endorsers, who act like the “walking billboards” (Zeithaml and Bitner, 2003) for the cosmetic service industry. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a dual qualitative approach to data collection, coupling netnographic material from Instagram posts with 16 in-depth interviews with female Instagram users who have undergone or hope to undergo cosmetic surgery. Using mediated discourse analysis, the authors weave their visual and discursive data together for a richer account of the commoditisation of cosmetic surgery. Findings: Adopting a postfeminist neoliberal lens, where women are viewed as aesthetic entrepreneurs who are constantly working on the body and the self, the findings of the study reveal how influencers’ aesthetic and emotional labour help package, propagate and demystify the cosmetic servicescape. Through their visual storytelling, we see how influencers help endorse (local) cosmetic services; commoditise cosmetic procedures through the conspicuous display of their ongoing body projects whilst masking the labour and pain involved; and how face-filters that use augmented reality (AR) technology foster new forms of (digitised) body dysmorphia. Originality/value: The authors shed light on the darker side of social media and body-enhancing technologies, where tales of body transformation trivialise cosmetic intervention and AR technology induces a digitised body dysmorphia. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The methodology used combines the focus group technique (seven groups) with a content analysis of the profiles of the informants (N = 651). In total, 53 first-year creative industries university students participated. The results show that the work developed by the influencers has given rise to an aspirational narrative genre that young people tend to emulate according to the Instagram habitus in order to be recognised as leading players. Their self-presentation has three main features: a) a preference for showing ‘in-classifying’ practices such as leisure and tastes for freedom; b) the predominance of a specific type of profile and gestures that avoids self-production markers and aspires towards a global audience; and c) the normalisation of self-promotional discourse. Most informants experience Instagram as a game in which they compete to accumulate visibility conceived as relational validation, although in the case of Colombian informants there is a more professional outlook towards the platform. Finally, for all of them, Instagram constitutes a serious game, and many of them admit to feeling too exposed. As a result, they have implemented self-surveillance practices, such as consulting with peers before posting photographs, using secondary accounts and deleting posts. © 2022 Communication & Society."

By facilitating real-time interactions between video content creators (i.e. streamers) and viewers, live-streaming platforms provide an environment for novel engagement behaviors and monetization structures. This research aims to examine communication foci and styles as levers of streaming success. In doing so, the authors analyze their impact on viewers' engagement with the stream. Design/methodology/approach: This research draws on a unique dataset collected via a multi-wave questionnaire comprising viewers' perceptions of a specific streamer's communications and their actual behavior toward them. The authors analyze the proposed impact of communication foci on viewing and donating behavior while considering the moderating role of communication style using seemingly unrelated regressions. Findings: The results show that communication foci represent a double-edged sword: community-focused communication drives viewership while reducing donations made to the streamer. By contrast, content-focused communication curbs viewing but drives donating. Practical implications: Of specific interest for practitioners, the study demonstrates how streaming content providers (e.g. influencers) should adjust their communications to drive engagement in the context of synchronous social media such as social live-streaming services. Beyond that, this research identifies unique characteristics of engagement that can help managers to improve their digital service offerings. Social implications: Social live-streaming services provide an environment that offers unique opportunities for self-development and co-creation among social media users. By allowing for real-time interactions, these emerging social media services build on ephemeral content to provide altered experiences for users. Originality/value: The authors highlight the need to distinguish between engagement behaviors in asynchronous and synchronous social media. The proposed conceptualization sheds new light on success factors of social media in general and social live-streaming services specifically. To maximize user engagement, content creators in synchronous social media must consider their communications' focus (content or community) and style (utilitarian or hedonic). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The use of social media applications such as Instagram provide patients with a plethora of information on procedures, such as direct composite bonding, veneers of different types and the align, bleach and bond protocol. When using social media applications, it is common to see advertisements for ‘peroxide-free’ gels, from a range of brands, many of which ‘influencers’ and celebrities are paid to endorse. These direct-to-consumer products allow the patient to bypass the traditional method of speaking to their dental practitioner. This coupled with the reach that some of these companies possess on social media platforms means that patients could be putting their future dental health at risk. This article outlines the risks involved in the use of ‘peroxide-free’ bleaching gels, which are becoming increasingly popular among patients. Furthermore, the article also outlines the potential pitfalls associated when ‘peroxide-free’ gels are used in conjunction with other unregulated dental products such as ‘charcoal toothpastes’ and ‘direct-to-consumer aligners’ CPD/Clinical Relevance: This article aims to help clinicians to recognize and discuss the dangers associated with unregulated whitening products and direct-to-consumer orthodontics with patients. © 2022 George Warman Publications.

These sponsored posts are placed next to nonsponsored posts (NSPs) on SMIs’ Instagram profiles. In the current study, we investigate how consumers engage with sponsored posts compared to NSPs and how engagement varies when such are posted by microinfluencers compared to macroinfluencers. Moreover, we explore engagement with sponsored posts containing different advertising appeals based on the advertising strategy, which determines whether sponsored posts contain appeals based on factual and rational information (i.e., informational appeals) or emotional and personal information (i.e., transformational appeals). Using a binomial regression on a unique data set of 64,438 sponsored Instagram posts by SMIs, we show that (1) users engage more with sponsored compared to NSPs, (2) particularly by microinfluencers, and (3) users engage more with sponsored posts with informational appeals by macroinfluencers than by microinfluencers. These findings provide meaningful insights for both advertisers interested in employing influencer marketing and SMIs interested in cooperating with advertisers for sponsored posts; the findings also advance the literature on influencer advertising and marketing. © 2022 The Author(s).

A 3 (control, congruent, incongruent brand) × 2 (control, COVID-19 message) between-subject online experiment was designed and executed. Data were analyzed using a mediated moderation model. Results indicated that the three-way interaction of the COVID-19 message, brand presence and prior parasocial interaction affected the perceived influencer credibility, attitudes towards the social media post, and the behavioral engagement with the post. When the COVID-19 message was included in the post, increased prior parasocial interaction intensified the positive effect of influencer-brand fit on influencer credibility, which in turn resulted in a more positive attitude towards the post, and a higher behavioral engagement.

There is a risk of dissemination of inaccurate information about urological conditions on social media. Physicians, as key opinion leaders, must play a role in sharing evidence-based information through social media. Objective: To identify and describe the top 100 urology influencers on the Twitter social media platform and to correlate Twitter influence with academic impact in urology. Design, setting, and participants: Twitter influence scores for the search topic “urology” were collected in April 2022 using published methodology. The top 100 personal accounts with the highest computed scores were linked to individuals’ names, all-time h index, geographic location, specialty, attributed sex, and board certification status in this cross-sectional study. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We examined the correlation between influence rank and h index. Results and limitations: Of the top 100 Twitter influencers on the topic of urology, the majority are from the USA (64%), male (85%), and practicing urologists (91%). Some 93% of US urology influencers are board-certified. Only 22 of the 50 US states are represented. The second most frequent country is the UK, with ten urology influencers. The median all-time h index is 42 (interquartile range 28.25–58). There is a weak positive correlation between influence rank and h index (r = 0.23; p = 0.02). Limitations of the study include the inability to validate the accuracy of the proprietary ranking algorithm and investigation of just one social media platform. Conclusions: The top Twitter influencers in urology are mostly board-certified US urologists. Collectively, influencers have a relatively greater academic impact in comparison to the average urologist, although there is a weak positive correlation between Twitter influence and h index among top Twitter influencers. Patient summary: Given the explosion of medical information on Twitter, we report the personal accounts with the greatest impact for the topic of “urology”. We found that most urology influencers on Twitter are US board-certified urologists with a strong research history. © 2022 European Association of Urology"

Social media can be used as a boundary-spanning technology to help bridge the research-practice gap. To support this idea, we present a process model of five research activities—networking, framing, investigating, disseminating, and assessing—and describe how social media can make each activity more open. We present a framework of four social media-enabled open academic approaches—connector, observer, promoter, and influencer—and outline some do's and don'ts for engaging in each approach. We also discuss the potential dark side of openness through social media and offer some coping strategies.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a web-scraped data set of Instagram influencers. It measured community strategy using influencers’ number of followers, number of following and breadth of interest; content strategy using modality type and number of posts; competition using number of influencers operating in the same primary domain of interest; and follower engagement behavior using number of likes and comments. A negative binomial regression model was estimated to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The findings reveal that elements of influencers’ community and content strategies, such as number of followers, modality type and number of posts, influence follower engagement behavior. Similarly, competition significantly influences follower engagement behavior both independently and by interacting with influencers’ community and content strategy. Practical implications: The findings offer insight for brands to identify suitable influencers for partnerships. For instance, brands can judge influencers’ suitability for partnership based on how many followers they have, how many posts they share and how many competitors they have. Further, the findings offer insight for influencers on how they can drive follower engagement behavior by managing their social media community and content. Originality/value: This study develops an integrated model of factors that determine follower engagement behavior for social media influencers. The findings emphasize influencers’ strategy as the primary driver of follower engagement behavior.

To examine this question, the present study is based on a cross-sectional survey with 419 social media users. Data are analyzed based on a structural equation model. Findings demonstrate that matching potential donors’ ideal self-concept positively affects competence belief, while aligning with potential donors’ actual self-concept positively increases benevolence/integrity belief.

Overall, the extant literature has been classified into three major clusters that examine sources involved in influencer marketing, message, and audience.

Theoretically, this research is the first to (1) map out followers’ gratifications pertaining to their interactions with influencers across discrete social media platforms and (2) explore how these varying gratifications and platform characteristics affect influencer–follower relation and subsequent advertising outcomes. In our current investigation, we take individual factors (gratifications) and platform factors (characteristics) into consideration. We demonstrate that consumers’ interactions with influencers are contingent on the specific affordances and characteristics of social media platforms. We find that the platform factors (characteristics) and individual factors (i.e., consumers’ fulfilled gratifications) positively correlate with the parasocial relation (PSR) between influencers and followers. The strength of influencer–follower PSR differs as a function of the platforms. More importantly, this influencer–follower PSR positively predicts advertising outcomes across different platforms. © 2022 American Academy of Advertising."

On mainstream social media platforms, opinion leaders are the major channels to spread opinions and media content to a large population of consumers. Therefore, analyzing how users respond to the blogs of opinion leaders lies at the core of understanding user engagement in social media. In this article, to study the factors that have great impacts on user engagement, we first collect a cross-platform opinion leaders&#x2019; blogs dataset, which includes 344 643 blogs published by 93 opinion leaders who have accounts on both Weibo and WeChat, the two most popular social media platforms in China. Based on this dataset, we conduct both characteristics study and semantic study to investigate the impact factors of user engagement with respect to blogs of opinion leaders. To find out the associations between user engagement and practically accessible attributes of opinion leaders and their blogs, we adopt state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentiment analysis models to process the blog data, develop a normalization technique to alleviate the issue caused by the heterogeneity of fall-out intervals of blogs, and devise a saliency method to compute the integrated gradients of sentences in blogs. Utilizing these computational tools, we reveal that user engagement on the two platforms agrees on some common factors, such as the number of tokens of blogs. Meanwhile, the two platforms differ in some aspects. For example, the semantic patterns that can improve the level of user engagement on the two platforms are very different. Our analysis can provide advertisers with valuable insights on how to plan an influencer marketing campaign on the two platforms. IEEE"

The success of any marketing strategy can simply be attributed to its ability to achieve desired objectives. Hence, to advise brands, the present study examines the role of influencer credibility and influencer-brand congruence in impacting the brand’s two main goals of conducting influencer marketing campaigns on Instagram, i.e., brand attitude and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) intention. This research intends to recommend which factors brands should consider while selecting influencer(s) for their marketing campaigns on Instagram. A survey using a self-administered questionnaire was performed on 383 Instagram users. Data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique. The findings indicate that expertise, similarity, and congruence have a positive relationship with brand attitude.

The posts seek to debunk online misinformation and provide facts regarding COVID-19. Mrozinski's social media content exemplifies what the article terms ‘public health pedagogy’ (PHP) – pedagogy that is informed by public health principles and that is undertaken outside traditional educational institutions. The article also asks: ‘How exactly does Mrozinski respond to misinformation actors and to what extent does this diminish the effectiveness of his PHP?’ The article investigates whether Mrozinski's hostility towards these actors actually invokes stereotypes of medical experts as elitist and uncaring.

Our focus is on the tweets of the top influencers of the hashtag #IStandWithGreece who strategically promoted ideologies ranging from white supremacism to Greek nationalism, glued together by an antimigrant stance during a border ‘crisis’ at Europe’s periphery. This network of intolerance promoted a representation of migrants as ‘pawns’; seen like a chess piece, with no value in their own right, literally pushed towards Europe by Turkey, who elevated them into a sizable threat. Within this, Europe was represented as a paradoxical other, the fallen Self, for not rising up to the opportunity to protect its sovereignty and identity through more securitization. Despite being diffused by extreme antimigrant Twitterers, we argue that these tweets offer a more overtly racist expression of otherwise mainstream European (Union) discourses and politics on migration. Effectively, #IStandWithGreece’s influencers functioned as Europe’s alter-ego mouthpiece, saying the unsayable using social media, and their affordances contributing to the normalization of an oppressive and restrictive European border management. © The Author(s) 2022."

It provides an avenue for one-to-one interactions that are private and conversational. This study examines the role of dark social in marketing communications and how influencers can help organizations enhance customer engagement. Four case studies involving influencers and without are analyzed through the Integrated Relationship Management Framework developed based on the Commitment-Trust, Social Exchange, and Customer Relationship Management theories. Findings show that dark social is significant for organizations as it supports personalized interactions and drives engagement. The use of influencers further amplifies campaign reach. Online community engagement and user-generated content can increase brand loyalty, creating a favorable relationship with audiences before crisis. We propose a Dark Social Influencer Engagement Framework that allows organizations to personalize communications and circumvent risk factors like sustainability, loss of content control, lack of cultural sensitivity, failure to align with audiences and overtly opportunistic behavior.

We find that both the firm and influencers can achieve a win–win outcome with the use of the SBC (PBC) if product quality is sufficiently low (high), but they cannot reach a consensus on using the same contract when selling the products that fall into a moderate range. Moreover, with the increased network overlapping effect, that is, endorsed influencers comprise a group with a larger number of similar followers, both the firm and influencers are more (less) likely to use the SBC (PBC); a stronger followership traffic effect, quantified by the number of followers, may cause difficulty in alignment of interests in influencer marketing contracting.

Word-of-mouth (WOM) is increasingly important in business-to-business (B2B) decision-making. Yet, research on this topic is rather limited, and often borrows from business-to-consumer (B2C) WOM literature. The question remains as to whether these assumptions realistically occur in B2B WOM. Specifically, this study explores the following questions: What value does B2B WOM have? Why do social media influencers in B2B engage in WOM? What type(s) of social media influencers spread WOM in B2B? Design/methodology/approach: To address these questions, this study adopts a qualitative research strategy. This study focuses on industry analysts in information technology markets who often influence the buying decisions of customers through their expertise and recommendations of technology solutions. Based on interviews with these influencers, this study explicates B2B WOM, an area the authors know much less of in comparison to B2C WOM. Findings: This study reveals differences in who spreads WOM within B2B, their roles, key features of their content and how they spread WOM. Second, this study demonstrates the types of actors spreading WOM in B2B in relation to the type of WOM and how it actually influences B2B markets. Originality/value: This study broadens the current definition of WOM and, specifically, showcases WOM not only as amplifying messages but as a means to co-create the market itself with vendors and clients.

Based on the stimulus-organism-response framework, this paper aims to address this lacuna by examining how influencer-created content affects the willingness of followers to search for more information related to the posted product. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional research design uses a web-based questionnaire among Instagram users in Sri Lanka. Structural equation modelling with analysis of moment structures 27 and SPSS PROCESS macro are used for hypothesis testing. Findings: Findings indicate that the commercial orientation of influencer-created content reduces follower trustworthiness towards them and the perceived credibility of the content. Mediation results demonstrate that the commercial orientation of influencer-created content negatively affects follower willingness to search for more information related to the posted product through trustworthiness and perceived credibility. Practical implications: When adopting influencer marketing to stimulate information search behaviour, marketing practitioners should carefully examine the commercial orientation of the content of the messages posted by social media influencers to maintain high levels of follower trustworthiness towards the influencer and positive follower credibility perceptions of the message.

A convenience sample of eligible participants was used to recruit the study participants. A 32-items questionnaire was distributed via social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram).

The development of advertising and retail on the platform was characterized by open-ended third-party experimentation and innovation, which was gradually incorporated into, and controlled by, the platform.

Design/methodology/approach: One-on-one interviews were conducted with 26 college students with self-reported or clinically diagnosed food allergies, recruited from two universities located in the southern region of the United States. The participants were asked a series of questions based on a semi-structured discussion guide. Each interview lasted about 30 min; all interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were coded independently by three researchers, and themes were identified. Findings: Food allergies affected the participants' food-related behaviors, including eating, food preparation and shopping, as well as some aspects of their quality of life. Individual factors, such as mood, other diseases, cultural background and sensory properties, also influenced food choices. Friends and families were the two most important social influencers of food choices.

Consumer online brand engagement, including consuming, contributing, and creating brand-related content, is closely related to a brand’s reputation and image. This study determines how the two aspects related to influencer endorsement—namely, influencer–follower parasocial interaction (PSI) and influencer–brand congruence (congruence)—affect the three levels of consumer online brand-related activities (COBRAs) on Sina Weibo. We also examined the mediation effect of consumers’ personal identification (PI) and social identification (SI) with brands in this process. The data were collected from 390 Weibo users in China, and valid data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that PSI and congruence have a direct positive effect on consuming brand-related content; PSI has an indirect influence on contributing brand-related content through SI’s mediation effect; and both PSI and congruence contributed to creating brand-related content, with the mediating effect of PI and SI. This study extends the literature on the motivation of consumer–brand engagement (engagement) on social media and discusses the roles of PI and SI in influencer marketing, filling a gap in the research and bringing new perspectives for brands and corporates. © 2022 American Academy of Advertising."

Social media is being used not only for getting connected with people but also for media sharing, diffusing information, and even marketing. Social media marketing has a significant impact because it can target campaigns appropriately based on the segmentation of the products to be marketed. Furthermore, this approach can provide campaign costs that are less expensive than other traditional methods. One of the methods which are generally used is an endorsement. With the popularity of social media, a new type of endorsement called social media endorsement has been born. This type of endorsement incorporates social media influencers to promote products and goods. However, product and brand owners find it difficult to select suitable influencers to endorse their products. Therefore, we try to solve this problem by creating a recommender system using the clustering method. We collect data from Instagram, one of the most popular social media platforms. The result showed that three clusters produced out of the data had high quality. In addition, we applied Silhouette Coefficient to validate the result, which produced a positive result on 7.277 X 10-3. With such a result, we conclude that this model could be used to categorize which brands or products an influencer normally endorse and recommend product or brand owners if an influencer is suitable based on clustering. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License"

Design/methodology/approach: Using 28 interviews with salespeople, this paper develops six propositions and a conceptual framework that outlines when and how B2B salespeople use social media in value-creating sales. Findings: This study’s findings provide a critical analysis of when social media are most effective and beneficial in supporting salespeople’s value-creating sales in various stages in the sales process (e.g. prospecting, opening relationships, qualifying prospects and serving accounts) and when they are less effective (e.g. presenting sales messages and closing sales). Research limitations/implications: This research yields a substantive understanding of the evolving role that social media play in B2B sales by examining B2B salespeople’s value creation strategies through the lens of social media influencers’ practice and outlines ideas for future research on B2B salespeople’s social media strategies. Practical implications: The findings of this research can be used by B2B organizations to structure the training of B2B salespeople to use social media to the fullest extent by aligning specific strategies with different parts of the sales process.

Results indicated that perceived expertise was important in consumers’ evaluation of product endorsement messages, whereas perceptions of endorsers’ trustworthiness did not differ across the three conditions. In terms of endorsement effectiveness, celebrities and SMIs had more significant impacts on consumer responses than fellow consumers when endorsing a brand owned by the celebrity, in which perceived expertise mediated the relationship between endorser type and advertising effectiveness. In addition, the endorser-consumer congruency is more prominent to SMI endorsements than to peer endorsements, whereas the endorser-product congruency is more crucial to peer endorsements than to celebrity endorsements.

Bad news or opinions against his government have been officially treated as fake, inaccurate, or false information. In this context, data show a decrease in news trust and growing news consumption through platforms. According to the 2021 Reuters Institute report on news trust, only 21% of Brazilians trust the press as an institution, with 71% using social media platforms to be informed. As part of a broad and complex crisis of the traditional intermediary model, several journalists appeared in the Brazilian public sphere as influencers on social media platforms such as Twitter. Based on a qualitative perspective, this article aims to research the role of journalists as political influencers and their use of Twitter to express their voices. A sample of 10 journalists with more than 10,000 followers on Twitter, five working for traditional media and five from native digital media, were interviewed in depth. We realized that they use their digital capital in two political directions. On the one hand, as part of a digital strategy promoted by media outlets to gain attention and call the audience, journalists share their spots and comments on daily issues. On the other hand, in a polarized political context, journalists have found Twitter a means to express their voices in a context of increasing violence and restrictions on free expression among this collective. © 2022 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal)."

By exploring the role of nowadays’ “influencer-mompreneurs” on Instagram, our research provides a springboard to holistically investigate an up-to-date facet of female entrepreneurship in the digital era and to identify the determinants of its success. Design/methodology/approach: This study took place in Tunisia and examined a sample of 20 female followers of three successful influencer-mompreneurs. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted through semistructured interviews. To analyze the collected data, the authors used thematic analysis, through which the determinants of influencer-mompreneurs’ success on Instagram bearing on Tunisian followers’ perspectives and previous literature were identified. Findings: The results suggest that the key determinants of influencer-mompreneurs’ success from their followers’ perspectives depend on their personal traits and their shared content. This is consistent with previous theories and models. In particular, source credibility theory and Ducoffe’s model of advertisement value, which to our knowledge, has not yet been wholly served with regard to influencer marketing research. Paradoxically, the findings reveal that “sharenting” details of their private lives as well as those of their children is also a determinant of influencer-mompreneurs’ success. Originality/value: Research into influencer-mompreneurs’ success with presence of their children on Instagram can help to provide valuable insights because existing literature into the subject is ambiguous and requires further research to clarify this research gap. Furthermore, by broadening the view of a new form of women entrepreneurship in relation to mother-influencer marketing, this study will inspire future research to dig deeper into creative women owned businesses and to support such emerging economies in the African context. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Socially interconnected community members are resources whose efforts can be mobilised to improve COVID-19 coping within their social networks. This research examined the feasibility, acceptability, and reach of a social media-based peer influencer intervention for COVID-19 coping. Over a 9-month period in 2020, the project enrolled 1253 social influencers in Milwaukee—primarily ethnic and racial minorities—who regularly received and passed along messages to members of their social networks that provided advice about COVID-19 pandemic coping, economic survival, health protection, mental health, family needs, social justice and other impacts. Messages were shared by influencers with others over social media and also text messages, phone calls and conversations. Facebook social media tracking metrics objectively measured the community reach of social influencers' messages. Quantitative surveys and qualitative follow-up interviews with a subset of influencers also measured the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Social media monitoring metrics showed that, by the end of the project, influencers' messages reached an average of 7978 unique individuals per week and had an average of 13,894 total views per week, with more than 140,000 total cumulative organic impressions. More than half of social influencers indicated that—beyond Facebook message sharing—they shared COVID-19 prevention, care, and coping messages with social network members in conversations, phone calls and text messages. Social influencers reported that they valued having the opportunity to help community members to cope with pandemic stressors by conveying practical COVID-19 coping advice. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

One important factor in this difference and reluctance may be the competitive advantage that the absence of regulation bestows to a platform. Indeed, a popular platform newly enforcing content moderation may fear that it will damage its user base by causing users to migrate to another less-heavily regulated platform. Moreover, since the migrating users can continue their harmful activities in the alternative platform, such regulation may end up being ineffective against information pollution. The goal of this article is to understand this competitive aspect of content moderation on platforms by considering the motivations of all players (platformer, news source, and social media users), characterizing the possible regulation policies that can be sustained in equilibrium, and evaluating the resulting quality of information in each platform. The model indicates that a popular platform can enforce any strict regulation without losing users if (1) the platform provides high social interaction quality, (2) news information is diffusive among users, (3) the social network structure has cohesive blocking clusters, and (4) many users are distant from the influencer. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

This study focuses on amplification by elites on social media and examines the extent to which traditional media and emerging partisan influencers engage in “network amplification.” Defined as like-minded elites sharing similar or/and mutual messages, network amplification highlights the interrelation and interaction between elite messages in the network communication environment of social media. This is a phenomenon worth investigating because network amplification’s resulting message repetition and reinforcement can multiply the overall effectiveness of elite messaging. Using network sampling and spectral clustering, we collected 358,707 accounts that followed 2,069,311 accounts on Twitter and detected nine distinct networks of traditional media and emerging partisan influencers. We then examined their 3,540,629 tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that 1) conservative media and influencers engaged in network amplification of politicized information and misinformation significantly more than liberal media and influencers did; 2) conservative influencers exhibited a stronger tendency to retweet and align their messages with conservative media than liberal influencers did regarding liberal media; and 3) traditional media partially drove partisan influencers’ amplification.

Consequently, when confronted with green advertising appeals, individuals often infer ulterior motives, do not purchase sustainable products and are less inclined to behave pro-environmentally. Based on their success in regular advertising campaigns, social media influencers (SMIs) have been recommended as endorsers for green products to increase advertising effectiveness and sustainable behavior, but no empirical evidence supports these suggestions. An online study with a two-level between-subjects experimental design (N = 145) was employed to validate the positive impact of green advertising on SMIs’ followers compared to non-followers. Results indicate that followers, who have established an intense parasocial relationship with the SMI, believe them to be more trustworthy and consequently attribute affective rather than calculative motives. The attribution of an affective motive, in turn, increased green advertising effectiveness. Furthermore, parasocial relationships enhanced pro-environmental intentions regarding sustainable behavior. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

As a consequence, they leave much open to interpretation by professionals, an openness that may place the public and professionals at risk. This is particularly of note as therapists are increasingly making use of social media and many professionals are taking on roles as mental health influencers, both purposefully and without realising. Such developments raise many important ethical issues including considerations around influencer competency, integrity, the maintenance of confidentiality and risk management. These issues are briefly discussed in this paper alongside related current research focusing upon them. It is concluded that, despite the existence of ethical guidelines focusing upon social media use by therapists, current research suggests that therapists are not consistently following these guidelines.

Plain Language Summary: Risk communication on vaccines during the COVID19 pandemic: is there room for small size or private initiatives? An Israeli experience Background: The scientific communication landscape has undergone a significant disruption since the COVID-19 pandemic: a huge number of publications, ample use of preprint publications, a fast-spreading digitalized information. This reflected the unprecedented speed of the research on disease and vaccines. Two kinds of infodemic blew up very soon: a scientific and a tabloid one. With knowledge evolving continuously, governments and institutions deployed their communication campaigns very quickly to explain the different measures, including the vaccination strategies and to fight against infodemics.

Extant SMI literature has primarily focused on the influence mechanism exerted by SMIs on their followers. Less is known about how followers view their favorite SMIs. This study aims to explore the SMI–follower relationship from the follower’s perspective and examine the underlying attachment mechanism. Design/methodology/approach: First, a qualitative study was conducted to explore the attributes that individuals consider following an SMI and ensure that it is consistent with the literature review. This was followed by a survey-based quantitative study where a structural equation modeling technique was used to test the hypotheses using 508 SMI followers. Findings: Followers find the SMI as a source to fulfill their intrinsic needs, that is, need to escape or self- improvement. The findings of this study suggest that followers attribute glamor, fun and connectedness to the SMIs driven by their need for self-improvement and fun with their need to escape. Finally, these attributions influence the overall perceived image of the SMI in followers' minds. Originality/value: This study uses qualitative and quantitative approaches to picture SMIs as human brands from a follower's need fulfillment perspective. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This article interrogates the role of the knowledge influencer, or those who perform micro-celebrity to convey information and expertise to lay audiences. Knowledge influencers can be doctors, lawyers, or anyone, regardless of class, who is an expert in their occupation. In doing so, knowledge influencers perform what I call calibrated expertise, or the curated performance strategy in which experts harness social media affordances, platform dynamics, and aspects of micro-celebrity to impart information. Through a case study analysis of social media veterinarians on Instagram, I show how calibrated expertise is discursively performed, and knowledge influencers emerge, at a cultural moment in which neoliberalism continues to blur the lines between work and play, and populist backlashes against experts are ubiquitous. By navigating micro-celebrity, authenticity, and relatability, knowledge influencers put a human face and contemporary cultural spin on expertise. Though, this does not mean the knowledge influencer is the answer to sweeping distrust, but rather, is an untapped resource for considering information sharing and power dynamics in neoliberal, populist times. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Design: Cross-sectional survey among adolescents and adults who used the social media platform Twitch.tv (Twitch). Responsiveness to food marketing was self-reported as craving or purchasing any brands participants observed on Twitch. Participants completed three validated scales of food responsiveness: the revised 18-question Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), the external eating subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), and the External Food Cue Responsiveness (EFCR) scale. Adjusted linear regression models assessed the predictive ability of each scale on recall and responsiveness outcomes. Setting: Online survey. Participants: 568 Twitch users (90.1% male, 60.6% white, 43.7% aged 18-24, 25.9% under 18). Results: In separate adjusted linear regression models, scores on the TFEQ were not related to any outcome, while DEBQ scores related to product cravings (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.19, P=0.02). In contrast, scores on the EFCR scale were significantly associated with higher brand recall (IRR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.68, P<.001), product craving (OR: 3.93, 95% CI: 2.22, 7.17, P<.001), and purchasing behavior (OR: 3.97, 95% CI: 1.99, 8.26, P<.001). A subset of three EFCR scale items related to influencer marketing were similarly associated with each outcome with greater precision in the point estimates than the overall EFCR. Conclusions: The EFCR scale predicted recall of and responsiveness to food marketing via Twitch, suggesting its utility in monitoring the effects of food marketing on social media. © The Authors 2022."

A cultural figure defined by an avowedly uxorious disposition and the public celebration of his spouse, the wife guy is a prominent exemplar of 21st century celebrity masculinity. This article argues that the wife guy typifies the strenuous lengths mainstream popular culture goes to negotiate the intractable ‘problem’ of the ambitious and achieving woman and to ratify couplehood as a safe harbour in a post-#MeToo mediascape suffused with heteropessimistic affect. First emerging to identify a social media influencer subtype, the term has accrued a more expansive usage and is now routinely applied to men operating at higher echelons of stardom. Overlapping in many ways is what we term the family defender, which marks a point at which an association with one’s wife takes on attributes that converge with toxic masculinity, justified through rhetorical claims centred on defence of the family. We see the wife guy and family defender as marking different points in a spectrum of masculine performativity operating within the heterosexual marital union. This article uses several celebrity case studies to chart different points on this continuum. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

To broaden our understanding of such promotional politics in social media, this paper examines commercial collaborations between four Swedish influencers and two private companies that offer services enabled by specific neoliberal reforms during recent decades, and how they strive to present these services in a way that attracts an affluent but socially conscious middle-class. It argues that the political potential of influencers might not always be as spokespersons for a cause or party, but rather as ‘ideological intermediaries’ who promote a lifestyle to be inspired by, and aspire to. The analysis identifies the discourses that influencers draw on to achieve the promotional and ideological outcomes of commercial collaborations, as well as the authenticity labour that they perform in the texts. Further, the paper analyses how notions of authenticity also impact audiences’ interpretation and politicization of the collaborations, in the comment sections to the sponsored blogposts. © The Author(s) 2022."

This piece has two key concerns. Firstly, the article proposes the idea of semiotic immaterialism as a way to theorise the ‘virtual influencer’, a relatively new phenomenon in ‘the West’ to emerge from the consumer-driven world of social media and online influencers. Here, the discussion will focus predominantly on the various racialised and gendered (im)materialities involved in the digital consumption of virtuality, and its relationship to prosumerist practices online. Secondly, this study also problematises the ways in which ‘Western’ popular media texts present Japanese virtuality to consumers. It is argued that these constitute digital-Orientalist discourses of racialised and gendered Japanese Otherness. How does virtuality complicate the idea of (im)material consumption? How do virtual influencers challenge and/or reinforce normative ideologies of race and gender? Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the study addresses these questions through textual analyses conducted on Imma’s Instagram images and captions, alongside ‘Western’ popular media texts about Imma. Ultimately, it is argued that Imma, as a virtual influencer, represents how the (im)materiality of Japanese race and gender is materialised through the digital- and self-Orientalist commodification of Japanese virtuality. © The Author(s) 2022."

This study draws on a communication model to examine how factors related to the sender of a message (influencer), the receiver of the message (influencer's followers), and the message itself (influencer's posts) determine influencer marketing effectiveness. The findings show that influencer originality, follower size, and sponsor salience enhance effectiveness, and posts that announce new product launches diminish it. Several tensions arise when firms select influencers and manage content: Influencer activity, follower–brand fit, and post positivity all exert inverted U-shaped moderating effects on influencer marketing effectiveness, suggesting that firms that adopt a balanced approach along these dimensions can achieve greater effectiveness.

Hashtags (#), used to identify posts relating to similar topics, are utilized to search medical information, build a network, find providers, and discuss research. Previous OHNS literature in this arena includes a standard ontology, or list of hashtags, developed for the otology subspecialty. To date, the ontology of laryngology hashtags has not been created. The objective of this study is to propose a standardized ontology to use when discussing topics in laryngology on social media to maximize reach and effect. Methods: Using a combination of previously published techniques, along with laryngology specific adjustments, the authors developed a list of suggested hashtags. An initial list was systematically culled from laryngology Instagram accounts including academic programs, laryngology influencers (fellowship-trained laryngologists with publicly available professional accounts with greater than 500 followers), and professional societies/conferences. The list was abbreviated using current rate of use, specificity, and expert opinion. These were then categorized to include general terms, diseases and diagnoses, and treatment strategies Results: Across all culled Instagram posts, there were 240 unique laryngology hashtags used and 1152 total hashtags were applied. The authors derived unique terms to be included in the ontology for laryngology by expert opinion of fellowship-trained laryngologists. Conclusion: Laryngology is in the early stages of utilization of social media. Developing a specific ontology of hashtags to be used will optimize the reach and connections of term specific searches. © 2022 The Voice Foundation"

By integrating sponsored content from advertisers into their feeds, they create awareness and favorable attitudes for products and brands. The effectiveness of this sponsored content builds on close adaptation to the original content of the specific media platform. To ensure transparency, influencers are required to disclose sponsored content. While effects of such disclosure labels and disclaimers have been widely examined, less attention has been paid to context factors that may influence these effects, such as placement prominence. Building on the propositions of the Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM), this study aims to investigate the role of placement prominence as a moderator of disclosure effects. Results of an experimental study revealed that prominent placements support disclosure labels in reducing perceived deceptiveness of sponsored content, which positively affects influencer credibility and recipients’ attitudes toward the promoted brand.

While its implementation has been pervasively attempted, there is a lack of systematic and academic exploration of the practice. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the LSS ecosystem and its development through a literature review and an industry analysis. Moreover, by pinpointing the pitfalls in current practices, this paper presents the practical implications of LSS and provides recommendations and directions for future academic exploration. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of the present study was to investigate the developing trajectory, exclusive elements (such as multi-channel networks (MCNs) and live streamers) and other critical components of the LSS ecosystem using a mixed-methods approach that comprises content analysis of newspaper articles and press releases, literature view and industry analysis. Findings: The results of the analyses indicate the presence of several nonfungible modular components in the LSS ecosystem, including upstream suppliers, MCNs, live streamers and platforms. It was also found that inequalities and hierarchies are inherent to the LSS ecosystem as it currently exists: low-end participants in the LSS industry and small- and medium-sized enterprise owners, who constitute the majority of LSS practitioners, cannot reach the break-even point via LSS hosted by top-level live streamers or others (low-level live streamers, employees, etc.). Originality/value: This article discusses the LSS ecosystem based on the nature of the nonfungible modules within it. In addition, it discusses the modules (roles) and relationships among them based on the theory of ecosystem developed by previous studies. Furthermore, drawing from an analysis of the pitfalls in the LSS ecosystem, this article highlights strategies for two critical e-commerce processes: 1) choosing which type of LSS to apply based on the factors of brands, products and consumers and 2) integrating LSS to optimize post-sale service and appeal to the sustainability of development. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

By creating a productivity scale, I delineate new social disparities and risk factors brought on by the unprecedented shift to a work-from-home digital economy. Through theories of biopower, I argue that technology is not neutral, apolitical, or unequivocally in favour of equal access and human rights. The creation of a new social group termed the ‘technoprecariat’ during lockdown is discussed using a ‘cripqueer’ approach to digital feminism. I extend Judith Butler’s early work on gender performativity to the neo-liberal ideal of gender productivity, where the onus of appearing perpetually ‘productive’ in lockdown was mainly on women. By analyzing how women debunked productivity on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, I examine queer influencers whose profiles demonstrated the cost of social non-conformism. I reveal how three feminist activists Priyanka Paul, Durga Gawde, and Roshni Kumar subverted gender productivity during lockdown through their distinct aesthetic and political standpoints. © 2022.

We propose that the features of SM (e.g., idealized images of peers, quantifiable feedback) intersect with adolescent developmental factors (e.g., salience of peer relationships) and sociocultural gender socialization processes (e.g., societal over-emphasis on girls’ and women’s physical appearance) to create the “perfect storm” for exacerbating girls’ body image concerns. We argue that, ultimately, body image concerns may be a key mechanism underlying associations between adolescent girls’ SM use and mental health. In the context of proposing this framework, we provide empirical evidence for how SM may increase adolescent girls’ body image concerns through heightening their focus on (1) other people’s physical appearance (e.g., through exposure to idealized images of peers, celebrities, and SM influencers; quantifiable indicators of approval); and (2) their own appearance (e.g., through appearance-related SM consciousness; exposure to idealized self-images; encouraging over-valuing of appearance; and peer approval of photos/videos). Our framework highlights new avenues for future research on adolescent girls’ SM use and mental health, which recognize the central role of body image. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Despite this trend reversal that the industry is undergoing, academic efforts to investigate whether, and if so, why, consumers experience such attitudinal ambivalence in trust and distrust in the SMI landscape is notably lacking. Building upon the concept of attitudinal ambivalence between trust and distrust, this study addresses this gap in the literature. The study used a mixed-method approach. In Study 1, we conducted an exploratory, qualitative study using two focus group interviews. During the interviews, participants were asked to discuss the open-ended questions freely, which included such questions as “What do you think about your choice of SMI in terms of trustworthiness?” and “If you trust (or distrust, or feel ambivalent toward) SMIs, why?” Based upon the findings from Study 1, Study 2 developed and tested empirically the conceptual framework that describes the antecedents and consequences of consumers’ ambivalence within the SMI context: (1) whether SMIs’ personality traits (similarity and attractiveness) and content attributes (visual appeal and informativeness) promote consumers’ trust in the SMIs; (2) whether perceived ad clutter triggers their distrust of the SMIs’ branded content, and (3) whether the attitudinal ambivalence in trust and distrust affect their behavior (i.e., behavioral intention to imitate the SMIs’ product and brand choices) independently as well as interdependently. Except for attractiveness and visual appeal, the online survey consumer data supported the proposed relations strongly, and the results provide meaningful implications for both theory and practice. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Design/methodology/approach: Based on data collected from 251 Instagram HWIs followers, the authors empirically tested the conceptual model using structural equation modeling. Findings: First, the authors demonstrate that attitude towards HWIs positively impacts followers' attitude towards the promoted brands as well as their intention to purchase organic food brands. Second, followers' attitude towards HWIs is mainly influenced by perceived congruence, influencer credibility, and physical attractiveness. Finally, gender acts as a moderator, e.g. attitude towards HWIs is more likely to be influenced by perceived congruence and physical attractiveness among female followers. Practical implications: The findings allow organic brands' managers to understand the key antecedents of followers' attitudes toward HWIs, and therefore, better select talented influencers who are able to create purchase intentions among both existing and potential customers.

While the digital space in Hong Kong remains largely heterogeneous, the emergence of pro-government YouTube influencers has not only reshaped but also arguably reinforced the fragmented and polarized media landscape in Hong Kong. These influencers often utilize a mixture of nationalistic, conservative, and populist orientations, allowing them to demonstrate regime allegiance, advocate law and order, and frame themselves as the voice of the people through the strategic use of journalistic language. Parallel to the content providers of the alternative media outlets of the pro-democracy camp, these newer voices identified a niche and capitalized on the opportunity for fame. Their intervention unsettles the existing dynamics of the mediated public sphere, which has long been dominated by professional journalism and liberal discourse. © 2022 The Centre for Chinese Media and Comparative Communication Research, The Chinese University of Hong Kong."

This study employed qualitative thematic analysis and identified three themes related to reasons for abortion (i.e., relationship issues, not being ready for pregnancy, and other reasons) and one supplemental theme of bystander support. Findings highlight the efforts of many respondents to normalize abortion as an issue of women’s health and women’s rights. In fact, in response to the original post’s discussion regarding valid reasons for an abortion, most respondents remarked similarly that any reason is valid. While study limitations include concerns regarding generalizability, this study provides access to abortion experiences outside of a traditional health clinic survey and insight into the abortion beliefs of women, both who have and have not experienced an abortion. Findings are in line with previous studies which found that multiple reasons are cited for obtaining an abortion, but also revealed a more supportive climate than the divisive discourse typically portrayed in the media. This suggests the timing may be conducive for efforts aiming to normalize abortion and reduce stigma, including potential avenues for interventions (e.g., social networks and platforms).

We conducted a qualitative content analysis of the frames adopted by WeChat posts. Statistical results showed that news organization accounts used fewer conflict, human interest, and feminism frames than individual and corporate accounts in order to avoid controversy in cyberspace. This study also demonstrated the use of frames of menstrual stigma and public invisibility of menstruation was associated with the pro-feminist attitudes of followers, while the use of efficiency and respect frames was correlated with anti-feminist attitudes.

As part of this process, female alt-right influencers have emerged within various popular social media platforms and fringe outlets, seeking to build credibility for the movement with new audiences. Contrary to previous assumptions about women as harmless adherents of far-right ideology, alt-right women are emerging as “organic intellectuals”, influential in the formation of everyday beliefs and principles in congruence with the tenets of far-right ideology. Their narratives strategically weave far-right ideological discourses, such as the imminent crisis of white identity, with topical matters on lifestyle and well-being. This article examines the rhetoric of online influencers as they shape an ideological space which is contributing to the normalization or mainstreaming of far-right ideas. In doing so, it addresses two questions: How do alt-right female influencers narrate a far-right identity? How do they mainstream white supremacist ideas online? Drawing on new empirical material from a series of far-right podcasts, this article demonstrates that alt-right women strategically construct a “liberated” female identity rooted in femininity, traditionalism and gender complementarity, and problematize feminism and women's emancipation as constitutive of the crisis facing the white race. It further identifies the presence of an elaborate cultural narrative around white victimhood which alt-right influencers use to mainstream their ideology. To counter the perpetuation of far-right ideas in society, women's participation in shaping far-right ideology should not remain unaddressed. This article sheds some light on how a small but highly visible group of influencers are actively working to promote a dangerous far-right ideology. © 2022 Journal for Deradicalization.

Despite growing academic interest, only a few articles address managing influencer marketing from a firm’s perspective. In addition, there is scant knowledge of how influencers interpret organizations’ guidelines and produce the content associated with their commercial collaborations with brands. This omission is critical as influencers are in control of the message conveyed to the social media audiences and require managing in order to avoid image incongruity between the firms’s own and influencers’ communications. Drawing on a multi-method study including semi-structured interviews with destination marketing organizations and influencers, ethnographic observation and semiotic analysis of social media content, the findings contribute to two-step flow communication theory by showing how the “second step”, the influencer, decodes and transmits the commercial messages to his/her followers in the context of destination marketing. Destination marketing serves as an appropriate context for studying influencer marketing dynamics due to its complexity. In addition to more tangible elements, there are various intangible and immaterial characteristics of tourism offerings. Social reality – the destinations, milieus, places and businesses to be visited – and the campaign objectives are all entangled in the content narrative and interpreted by the influencer and her knowledge of her audience into what they could mean and become in the social media environments’ semiotic and symbolic landscapes. Influencer’s perception is embedded into the materiality of the social media environment. We argue that the interpretation and contextualization of the message occurs via two mediating layers: influencer’s creative process and the chosen technological platform’s materiality. While more tangible elements can be communicated easily to the target audience, more intangible elements require influencers’ interpretation. Influencers’ own interpretation and understanding of the intangible objectives and influencers’ perception of the social media audience’s understanding of the certain intangible element are determinative in the interpretation and contextualization of marketing messages of the campaign’s commercial stakeholders. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Researchers have revealed a variety of impacts of influencer marketing on both consumer behaviors and branding performance (Blackwell et al. 2017; Hollebeek et al. 2016; Schivinski et al. 2016; Vanmeter and Grisaffe 2015). However, there is a lack of evidence to answer whether consumers develop emotional attachment and to what extent towards the influencer and the brand involved in the brand-influencer collaboration. This research, founded on social attachment theory (Mawson 2005), adopts a mixed methodology approach to investigate the relationship between consumer satisfaction derived from influencer promoted purchases, influencer attachment, and luxury band attachment. In the context of influencer marketing, our research reveals positive relationships between consumer satisfaction, influencer attachment and luxury brand attachment respectively; furthermore, the positive impact of consumer satisfaction on influencer attachment is stronger than on luxury brand attachment. This research also identifies a positive moderating role of brand sponsorship on the relationship between consumer satisfaction and luxury brand attachment. Although the COVID-19 crisis has caused severe social and business isolation, it brings some exceptional opportunities for brands to bond with their target consumers through social media and influencer marketing. Our results show that consumers more autonomously engage in behaviors that enhance the development of attachment due to the social isolation under quarantine. This finding qualifies social attachment theory (Mawson 2005) to explain the occurrence of affiliation in the context of influencer marketing and identifies influencers as attachment figures to their online communities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This has also given rise to micro-influencers, who generate content and gradually form a community following and interacting with their social accounts. Micro-influencers differ with traditional celebrities in that the latter become renown through sporting, art or the like (De Veirman et al. 2017). Micro-influencers are perceived as more reflective of their followers (Jin et al. 2019), and are argued to wield powerful influence over consumer choice, despite their much less popularity and followings than traditional celebrities (Boerman 2020). This study examines the relationships among social communication variables relating to micro-influencers on social platforms: online opinion leadership (OOL) and parasocial interaction (PSI) as personal and interpersonal source characteristics, respectively (Sweeney et al. 2008); message quality as a message characteristic (Le et al. 2020); online interaction propensity (OIP) as a receiver characteristic (Labrecque 2014); and consumer engagement behaviours (CEBs) as responses with respect to product review elements including the content, the micro-influencer, and the product/ brand embedded in the post (Casaló et al. 2020). An online survey was conducted with a convenience sample of Vietnamese consumers who have previously purchased or planned to buy a mobile phone within 6 months and have viewed online reviews about mobile phones as part of their information search. A valid data of 371 responses was analysed using smartPLS 3.3.3. Findings reveal that OOL and PSI have significant impact on message quality (p &lt; 0.05), which in turn affects significantly CEBs (p &lt; 0.05): Intention to interact with the post; intention to follow advice of the micro-influencer; and intention to recommend the micro-influencer to others. While the result only finds OIP elevates the impact of message quality on consumers’ intention to interact with the post at p &lt; 0.10; findings show significant direct impact of OIP on CEBs, though not hypothesised. This research contributes to communication literature concerning consumers’ processing of persuasive cues and information exposed to them through the online environment. The research highlights the importance of essential factors requiring attention in micro-influencer marketing: OOL, PSI, message quality and OIP. The study also contributes to consumer engagement literature with evidence concerning the focal object as micro-influencers’ online product reviews. Practically, insights from this research suggest marketers need to detect micro-influencers, target them with appropriate communication strategies so as to influence their generated and disseminated content. Marketers can take the findings of effects on intention with the post and intention to recommend the micro-influencers in approaching micro-influencers for a win-win collaboration. The study also demonstrates OIP as an important individual trait in segmenting consumers for effective consumer engagement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Described as an offshoot of place branding, destination branding tends to be focused mainly on achieving tourism objectives (Braun 2012). One key antecedent of the increased global competition for tourists is the opening of emerging markets. Emerging markets have been positioned as the “growth engines of the world” (Sinha and Sheth 2018, p. 217). Despite this, there is a notable dearth of research on the destination branding of emerging markets (cf. Martinez 2016). To gauge the progress of this stream of research and inform future research, it is necessary to conduct a review of refereed journal articles (Williams and Plouffe 2007). This review aims to answer the following questions, (i) what are the trends in terms of journals, themes, emerging markets studied, and methodology?, and (ii) what branding methods have been used and which ones are more effective? This paper will provide a systematic review of the research on destination branding in emerging markets, something that has not been done to date. Although Dinnie (2004) and Vuignier (2017) review the literature, their reviews neither focus on destination branding nor on emerging markets. In line with the systematic search procedures e.g., Hao and Paul (2019), we searched for articles published in peer-reviewed journals on electronic databases and by scrutinizing the reference lists of related reviews. Overall, the search yielded 31 articles published in 13 journals spanning the years 2008–2019. The findings show that the majority of the articles were published in the Place Branding & Public Diplomacy journal. Additionally, emerging markets in East Asia (e.g., China) and the Middle East and North Africa (e.g., United Arab Emirates) were the most studied, while the Eastern European and South American emerging markets were not as widely studied. Moreover, the most widely-studied theme was destination/place image. With regard to the methodology, an overwhelming majority of papers used exploratory methods such. Our analysis of offline versus online branding efforts revealed that both are important; however, a combination of both is the most effective. In sum, this study developed a novel approach to analyzing destination branding. Research implications include the need for more confirmatory methods to enhance generalizability of findings. This study’s major limitation was having to make inferences due to the limited branding information. Thus, future research should incorporate more in-depth examinations of branding. For practitioners employing online techniques such as influencer marketing, it is best to use influencers who are natives of the destination to enhance credibility. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

A New Scale to Measure Brand Selfie Credibility: An Abstract",2022,"Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science","10.1007/978-3-030-95346-1_150","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133346934&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-95346-1_150&partnerID=40&md5=245b556c020e2f961351a233448f4634","There were 300 million selfies posted on Instagram in 2018 (Smith 2019), and many people are taking selfies with brands (Sung et al. 2018). Although brand selfies of average consumers are generally perceived as credible, some consumers generate fake brand selfie pictures. Furthermore, viewers evaluate credibility of a brand selfie based on its composition, as well as its components such as brand, person and context. Even though marketers need to choose reasonably credible brand selfies to use for their promotions, little is known about how viewers assess the credibility of a brand selfie. Hence, this research aims to develop a scale to empirically measure brand selfie credibility from the viewer’s perspective, and to identify the antecedents and outcomes of brand selfie credibility. The scale development followed established scale development methods (e.g., Churchill 1979; Gerbing and Anderson 1988). Based on exploratory qualitative and quantitative studies, this research project developed a 9-item scale to measure brand selfie credibility. Three dimensions identified through an exploratory qualitative study and confirmed by two expert panels are: brand selfie image trustworthiness, brand selfie congruence, and brand selfie meaning. This research also finds that brand selfie credibility is influenced by brand-related (consistency of the brand and clarity of the brand), person-related (altruistic motivation), and image-related (positive affect) antecedents. Additionally, brand selfie credibility impacts on purchase intention and positive word-of-mouth. This study provides a tool for marketers to understand consumers’ perception of brand selfies and consumers’ reactions. Marketers can identify how the brand selfie and its credibility can be leveraged for marketing purposes, and to choose credible brand selfie pictures for their marketing communication strategies. This is the first study to develop and validate the measures for brand selfie credibility on social media which contributes to user-generated content, influencer-generated content, photographic credibility and branding literature. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The study addresses the following research questions: what kinds of content do mature influencers elaborate to produce and convey their messages? How do they change the structural relationship between women and fashion? We selected 18 mature influencers, and employed a qualitative approach based on online ethnography and analysis of social media content. The findings suggest that older influencers are challenging the conventional ways of imaging old age and reshaping the cultural meanings associated with ageing, thus contributing to innovation in the social representations and to the creation of alternative imagery of older women. In doing so, they are producing an important discourse for women, the older adults and the whole of society. However, initial attempts by fashion houses to colonise them are emerging. © The Author(s) 2022."

In addition to SMI selection criteria such as number of followers, costs per post, engagement rate or audience characteristics, practitioners are also confronted with the decision problem of choosing the type of SMI based on their origin of fame, which refers to the way SMIs became known to their audience. Two types of SMIs can be distinguished based on their origin of fame. The first type is celebrities who became famous outside of social media (e.g., by being singers, actors or athletes). Because these SMIs have a non-social media origin of fame, they are referred to as “non-original SMIs”. The second type is celebrities who became famous in social media (e.g., by presenting their lifestyle). Because these SMIs have a social media origin of fame (e.g., “instafamous”), they are referred to as “original SMIs”. To explain the effects of SMIs’ origin of fame on social media users’ purchase behavior, this study draws on the concept of identification. In this context, identification is defined as the adoption of attitudes and behaviors of media personae through the process of social influence. With similarity and wishful identification, two distinct types of identification have been discussed in the literature. While the object of similarity identification are media personae that are similar to actual self of the media user, the object of wishful identification are media personae that are similar to the ideal self of the media user. In which type of identification media users engage depends on their level of self-esteem. While the favorite media persona of media users with low self-esteem is closer to their ideal self (i.e., wishful identification), the favorite media persona of media users with high self-esteem is closer to their actual self (i.e., similarity identification). This study investigates if social media users’ self-esteem moderates the effect of SMIs’ origin of fame on social media users’ purchase behavior. It thus aims to examine the effectiveness of the type of SMI based on social media users’ self-esteem. The results of an online experiment with 129 social media users in Russia reveal that non-original SMIs affect social media users’ purchase intentions stronger than original SMIs if social media users have low self-esteem. In contrast, original SMIs affect social media users’ purchase intentions stronger than non-original SMIs if social media users have high self-esteem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

However, due to some long-standing user biases towards computer services, especially compared to human service providers, it is widely believed that computer service providers are lack of ability. As a type of computer product, virtual influencers are highly anthropomorphic in terms of appearance, voice, identity, interaction, etc. Among them, the realistic appearance is an important feature of virtual influencers, which may be an important factor affecting users’ perception of their abilities, which in turn affect the advertising effectiveness. On the other hand, the controlling entity of virtual influencer is generally human or computer, that is, virtual influencer’s behavior is generally manipulated by human or computer. Past studies suggest that the controlling entity are also an important factor affecting user attitudes. Does appearance realism affect virtual influencer perception? What can we do to improve user attitudes towards virtual influencer advertisements? Is there an interaction effect between the virtual influencer’s appearance realism level and the type of controlling entity? Or, how does the virtual influencer’s level of appearance realism and the type of controlling entity match make the advertisement attitude better? We intend to conduct a 2 (appearance realism: high/low) × 2 (controlling entity type: computer/human) between-group experiments. The expected result are: tunder a high level of appearance realism, the effect of computer controlling entity is better than that of human-controlling entity. The reason is that high-level appearance realism improves the user’s ability to perceive virtual idols. The ability expectations of virtual influencers reduce perceived ability and thus advertisement attitude. We will further examine the moderating effect of product types. For search products, the effect of using computer controlling entity for virtual idols with a high-level appearance realism is enhanced, the advertisement attitude should be stronger; for experience products, human entity should perform better in advertising regardless high or low appearance realism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Considering source credibility of SMI (conceptualized by information value, trustworthiness and expertise) and the theory of parasocial relationship, this study examines the effect of brand fit on SMI’s perceived credibility and thus on the purchase intention using structural equation modeling. The findings reveal that SMI’s perceived credibility has a positive effect on purchase intention and parasocial relationship. The familiarity with the influencer, conceptualized by parasocial relationship, was found to have a significant mediating role, and brand fit is found to have a positive effect on credibility. The study also examines the effect of brand fit on the model, brand fit was found to have a positive significant effect on SMI’s credibility, but it weakens the effect of parasocial relationship on purchase intention. In addition, the study highlights the effect of different European Millennials’ characteristics on perceived credibility and purchase intention. Self-expression and deal-driven were found to strengthen the effect of brand fit on SMI’s credibility and also that on purchase intention, while selectivity and open-mindedness were found to strengthen the effect of brand fit on credibility but not on purchase intention.

In Finland, the Prime Minister’s Office initiated a communication campaign that utilized social media influencers to communicate timely instructions regarding the pandemic. However, it is uncertain how social media influencers adapt to briefings of public organizations given that they typically work with brands that align with their own interests and expertise, which rarely is epidemiology. We use the two-step flow of communication model and social influence theory to analyze research data that consisted of 96 Instagram posts, 108 Instagram Stories and 1097 comments. Qualitative content analysis was used to see how the influencers communicated about the pandemic and how their followers reacted. The results suggest that the influencers tried to adapt the messages to their own style, and, instead of committing to the wordings of the campaign, they shared general guidelines and, with their own example, showed how to behave during the pandemic. Their participation in the campaign helped affect social norms during the time of the crisis, which in the case of public health communication is a substantial, strategic goal. © 2022 The Author(s).

The growth of influencer marketing is not only relevant for firms’ marketing departments but is also interesting from an entrepreneurial value creation perspective. The advent of social media influencers has spawned a new generation of entrepreneurs who are active on social media platforms and eagerly create their network of followers. The simultaneous presence of many smaller networks results in a specific type of business model for digital platforms: the Platform-of-platforms (PoP) business model. The PoP business model describes a digital platform that allows other platforms to run on its infrastructure and to use its network effects to pursue entrepreneurial activities. To increase value-creating activities, social media platforms need to provide an adequate infrastructure and governance to support the creation of a constant stream of original content. In this paper, we conceptualize the advantages of this PoP business model for social media platforms as whole and for the user groups on the platforms.

Individuals with strong personal appeal and influence play a key role in facilitating greater brand outreach and better performance of online ads. Influencers convey similar or distinct persona to match different atmosphere of social media platforms and types of products and services that they intend to promote. Simultaneously, influencers constantly produce textual and visual narrations of their lives and experiences to enhance consumer trusts and foster consumer responses. However, little is known about the role of influencer personal image establishment on driving online consumer engagement. Besides, there are lack of researches that consider the consolidated effect of influencer persona and narratives during the persuasion process. Instagram, Facebook, Sina Weibo and Twitter have been the most examined social media platforms. However, short video-based social media platforms such as TikTok that embed distinct product and content structures still lack academic attention. In light of the significant role of influencers on consumer attitudes and behaviors, and as this research domain is still developing, a research from a new research perspective is needed. This study derives practical implications across various domains, such as social media marketing, digital advertising, and video advertisement in which identification of key factors of information propagators is essential.

The use of social media significantly positively influenced the research output and visibility of librarians. The study concluded that the use of social media can improve librarians’ research output and visibility, and thus recommends that more effort be made to expand the use of social media such as Yahoo, ResearchGate, Zotero, ORCID and LinkedIn, as well as greater awareness of social bookmarking tools such as Bibsonomy. © The Author(s) 2022."

It, additionally, explores the role of brand liking and ad enjoyment in this model of trust transfer. Data was collected from 354 respondents who were asked to complete online survey questions after watching video adverts featuring social media influencers endorsing different brands. The dataset was then analyzed using PLS-SEM techniques. Based on the analysis, influencer trust was found to positively affect brand trust, brand liking, and ad enjoyment. Brand liking was also found to positively affect customers’ brand trust. However, there was no support of ad enjoyment’s effect on customers’ brand trust. The results lend support to the theory of trust transfer in the context of social media influencer marketing. The findings from this study are useful for social media influencers, as they highlight the importance of nurturing a trusting relationship between them and their audience. This trust is expected to transfer to customers’ trusting in and liking of endorsed brands and therefore contribute to the success of the social media influencer business model. This study adds insights to the still growing research on social media influencer marketing, specifically shedding light on the effects of customers’ trust in influencers, a much-discussed area of late. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

However, it is unclear if such initiatives are also beneficial for SM profile owners such as influencers, who are the prime content creators on the SM platforms who use SM posts to build their influence within their network of followers. Our study investigates the effect of introducing one such new SM feature: the “story” on the creation and consumption of SM posts. Leveraging social penetration theory, we hypothesize the influence of introducing story feature on (1) the frequency of SM post creation by profile owners and (2) the extent of follower engagement with SM posts. Employing a quasi-experimental design, we find that the introduction of the story feature reduces the frequency of SM post creation, but the enhanced self-disclosure through the story feature increases follower engagement with the SM posts. However, these effects are moderated by the situating culture of the SM communities: while low-power-distance cultures value profile owners’ self-disclosure, high-power-distance cultures exhibit a mixed influence. Advancing literature on social penetration theory and SM user engagement, our study demonstrates that new self-disclosive SM content creation features do not necessarily benefit all the concerned stakeholders and that the effectiveness of such features might vary from one community to another. Hence, the intended impact of introducing new SM features needs to be carefully evaluated by SM platforms in a holistic manner. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

A three‐level between‐subjects survey‐based experimental design (manipulating the absence of ad disclosure versus ad disclosure in the participants’ native language versus standardized paid partnership ad disclosure in English) was conducted online with female adolescent participants (N = 241) in a European country. Findings showed that adolescents who understand the economic model behind SMI advertising have positive intentions toward the SMI and intend to spread online information about the promoted brand.

In such a highly uncertain environment, one can focus on multiround diffusion campaigns, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct users that are influenced or activated, starting from a known base of few influential nodes. During a campaign, spread seeds are selected sequentially at consecutive rounds, and feedback is collected in the form of the activated nodes at each round. A round’s impact (reward) is then quantified as the number of newly activated nodes. Overall, one must maximize the campaign’s total spread, as the sum of rounds’ rewards. In this setting, an explore-exploit approach could be used to learn the key underlying diffusion parameters, while running the campaign. We describe and compare two methods of contextual multi-armed bandits, with upper-confidence bounds on the remaining potential of influencers, one using a generalized linear model and the Good-Turing estimator for remaining potential (GLM-GT-UCB), and another one that directly adapts the LinUCB algorithm to our setting (LogNorm-LinUCB).

A national sample (N = 566) participated in a randomized online experiment including a real influencer and followers in order to investigate how different advertisement disclosure types affect advertising performance and how usage intensity moderates this effect. We find that disclosing an influencer’s postings with “#ad” increases the trustworthiness of the influencer and the general credibility of the posting for heavy users, but not for light users. Followership of a user has been found to strongly improve all researched variables (attitude toward product placement, trustworthiness of the spokesperson and general credibility of the posting). This study adds to literature the first distinction on heavy and light usage intensity, and on followership of an IG user when regarding the effects of advertisement disclosure types on advertising performance. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how advertisers, influencers, and SNS providers should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media users, e.g., to closely monitor an influencer’s audience to identify heavy users and optimally target them. © 2022, The Author(s)."

The production of cosmetics has been largely driven by consumerism and a bid to keep abreast with the latest trends in the beauty industry with less attention on how the users' quality of life (QoL) is affected. Aims: This study aims to investigate the effect of cosmetic products on users' quality of life in eight Arab countries. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out using an online data collection approach. A validated and specialist instrument tool called BeautyQoL, which consists of five domains and a total of 52 questions, was distributed to a sample of 2219 cosmetic users. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done using SPSS® version 26.0. Results: The mean age of participants was 34 ± 11.25 years, and more women were represented in the sample (71%) than men. The majority of respondents had oily skin type (39.6%) and tan skin tone (30.4%). QoL through cosmetic use is computed with a mean score of 51 out of 100. The users' mean score satisfaction from cosmetic use is centred on attractiveness (56.1), followed by self-confidence (51.8). Cosmetics have a statistically significant effect on participants who are young adults, women, single, and employed with high income. As the respondents' skin tone deepens from very fair to dark, the mean score for each domain significantly increases, whereas when skin type changes from very oily to dry, the mean score for each domain decreases. Conclusion: The effect of cosmetics on the users' QoL is limited, contrary to the narrative commonly portrayed in cosmetics' advertisements. Therefore, the use of cosmetics among the Arab population should be from an informed perspective of their specific needs instead of conforming to the viral trends pedaled by influencers and bloggers on social media, which might be irrelevant for them. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Against the backdrop of saturation fatigue and slacktivism through the rhetoric of #ThoughtsAndPrayers on social media, this study traces the behaviors of ordinary Instagram users and highly prolific influencers to understand how they hijack grief-related hashtags on Instagram through a variety of semiotic and textual strategies that problematizes digital mortality and the value of collective mourning. Specifically, the article uncovers an insidious shift from “public grieving” to “publicity grieving,” and brings together theories on micro-celebrity in celebrity studies, brandjacking in business studies, and grief publics in internet studies to examine the commodification of grief on social media. © 2022 The Author(s).

Drawing from source credibility theory, social cognitive theory, protection motivation theory and literature on physical activity, physical fitness and gender, we analyse how male and female users’ evaluations of social media fitness influencers and user health-related variables impact intentions to exercise with the social media fitness influencer. Methods: Two consecutive studies using male and female YouTube fitness influencers were carried out. Structural equation modelling was conducted to test the proposed models and estimate the path coefficients. Results: Study 1 (N = 507) shows that the respective influencer's perceived trustworthiness, expertise and attractiveness are important for the influencer's evaluation, and that it is the perceived motivating power rather than the attitude toward the influencer that increases intentions to exercise for male and female users. Study 2 (N = 445) extends Study 1 and shows that physical fitness, training involvement with YouTube fitness videos and lower health increase behavioural intentions. A more negative body image also raises intentions to exercise, but only among female users. Conclusion: Social media fitness influencers who are perceived as trustworthy, as experts and as attractive, can be effective for increasing men's and women's physical activity. Perceived motivating power of the influencer emerged as a key variable that predicts intentions to exercise. User health-related variables have different effects on intentions to exercise for men and women. © The Author(s) 2022."

In contrast, appealing to egoistic and altruistic values, as a frame amplification strategy, serves as stakes to bargain with patriarchy in exchange for male endorsement of feminist goals. It thus may bring unsustainable support to the feminist cause rather than a substantial social change. This study also exhibits frame transformation in chronological order to reveal the impact of symbolic socio-political events on frame-setting.

The aim is to investigate how teachers’ needs and actions form their roles in the extended staffroom. 26 teachers from six different Facebook groups within two different school subjects, mathematics and Swedish, are interviewed. The results reveal a trajectory from a lurking behaviour as authorised visitor to a key person within the community of the group or an influencer, where teachers can function as authorities in their field. In relation to this trajectory, the interviewed teachers describe the choice to become public as a crucial step, emphasising the courage needed. A next important step can be identified when teachers leave the role as consumers of content that others provide, asking questions and commenting on others’ posts, in favour of a more contributing role, publishing their own posts and expressing an agenda.

This study examines the potential interplay of perceived homophily with, perceived authenticity of an influencer and the reasons people may follow an influencer on subsequent purchase intentions of items the influencer has showcased on their Instagram account. Key findings suggest that the type of perceived homophily one shares with their favorite influencer is linked to the reasons they follow that influencer, and that following an influencer because they are trendy when a person also indicated perceived status homophily (e.g., similarities in size) did lead to increased purchase intent. However, influencers that are followed because they are unique and share morals and values with a follower (i.e., ‘value homophily’) do not encourage purchase intent. We find that an influencer who is perceived as more ‘authentic’ will mediate the relationship between perceptions of homophily and subsequent purchase intent. © 2022 Advertising Association."

From healthcare decision-making to social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with ethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical characteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons. This behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that helps AI agents identify when to break rules set by their designers. To understand when AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under which humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In this paper, we present a study that introduces a ‘vaccination strategy dilemma’ to human participants and analyzes their response. In this dilemma, one needs to decide whether they would distribute COVID-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow the enforced rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few social influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater benefit to society. The results of the empirical study suggest a relationship between stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which neither deontological nor utilitarian ethics completely explain. Finally, the paper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB and the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm. We hope that this will inform the design of future AI agents, and their decision-making behaviour. © 2022, The Author(s)."

To solve the managerial dilemma of balancing the tension between control and autonomy of influencers' output performance, this study aims to investigate how exercising output controls through performance rewards and performance punishments impact the quantity and quality of influencers' content generation. Design/methodology/approach: Choosing JD WeChat Shopping Circle as the research context and leveraging the introduction of a double commission subsidy policy and a removal policy as quasi-natural experiments, this study applied the difference-in-differences (DID) method to empirically test hypotheses. Findings: Performance rewards incentivize influencers to generate high-quality content, but such incentivizing effects attenuate over time. Performance punishment drives influencers to generate expected pieces of high-quality content, and such safeguarding effects accentuate over time. Originality/value: This study proposes output controls as an important form of governance mechanism in multi-sided platforms and substantiates how rewards and punishments as two facets of incentives affect complementors' behaviors.

In the tourism sector, new technology developments, the digital actions of firms and enterprises, and daily demands have all contributed considerably to the growth of digital tourism. This study paper analyzes information media and various information systems-applications in tourism. Tourism is specifically examined in terms of its evolution and impact on our daily lives via social media, digital advertising, and modern applications of digital marketing. Additionally, it assesses the value of information systems in enterprises, how they are implemented according to needs, and how they are updated to remain “current” with the modern needs of the tourism sector’s firms. The current research employs a primary research methodology, utilizing a questionnaire as a research tool, in combination with foreign and domestic academic literature and articles in the research subject. According to the percentages, respondents appear to have used a significant portion of their smart devices to look for vacation locations, demonstrating their familiarity with the Internet and the use of applications for tourist services such as accommodation. Apart from data analysis, the overwhelming majority appear to engage in leisure travel, mostly through current entertainment and communication tools such as social media, indicating that the user seeks information from acquaintances and friends. Users, or potential tourists, have begun and are continuing to follow Digital Tourism, have ceased blindly consulting agencies and travel businesses, and have embraced technology and the expansion of information technology in all parts of their life and tourism.

Design/methodology/approach: To gain insight into trends in influencer marketing from the influencer’s perspective, this paper uses qualitative research in the form of interviews with influencers and industry professionals. Findings: The findings highlight the importance of perceived authenticity for success in influencer marketing. Most interviewees indicated that they had noticed a boom in social media influencer marketing before the pandemic, yet provided mixed views regarding the market during the pandemic. Several believe that influencers will continue to be relevant in the increasingly digital world (e.g. increasing digital marketing spend and e-commerce), whereas an expectation of new digital platforms and innovations was also observed. In the long term, saturation and decreased effectiveness were predicted by several interviewees. Originality/value: This under-researched topic is of relevance especially to consumer goods companies, as social media marketing and influencer marketing are currently highly effective and popular tools. To refine marketing strategies designed around influencers, understanding the limitations, in the context of COVID-19, is crucial. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Participating in these platforms demanded a paradigmatic shift in branding and brand communication, which became more focused on listening to consumers and fans, interacting and collaborating with them, and nurturing mutually beneficial relationships. Digital influencers act as mediators between brands and their followers and play a pivotal role in social media marketing strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic, confinement periods imposed in many countries, and a reconfiguration of daily routines in post-confinement or deconfinement periods, had a profound impact on businesses, on consumption, and on branding. Many brands, unable to produce and market their products or offering their services for a considerable period, focused on their communication, on remaining relevant or becoming more relevant for their fans and customers. Brand communication on Instagram has changed during this short period, and our exploratory study sets out to map the main changes and to understand how brands, influencers and users perceive them, in the specific context of Portugal. This article presents results from an online survey to a purposive sample of 160 instagrammers, addressing their perceptions about the impact of these changes on their relationship with brands and influencers. We complement the perspective of users with interviews to 25 other relevant agents, namely Instagram influencers, marketing agencies and brands with relevant presence on Instagram. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

By doing so, companies can gain a broader customer base and, as a result, increase their sales and revenues. In todays’ digital world, the number of individuals’ work as social media influencers on various platforms is constantly increasing. With the help of the social learning theory, four major factors that make a particular influencer an effective source have been identified. This study tries to analyze the effects of these four factors—source credibility, source attractiveness, influencer-product fit, and meaning transfer—on both consumer attitude and consumer buying intention. The results showed that source credibility, influencer-product fit, and meaning transfer positively impact consumer attitude and buying intentions. Source attractiveness has been found to have no effect on either consumer attitude or buying intentions. Consumer attitude has also been identified to mediate the relationships between source credibility, influencer-product fit, meaning transfer, and buying intentions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This study established a cat Instagram account and uses ethnographic methods to investigate the phenomenon of pet Instagram as a kind of affective community co-habited by humans and nonhuman others. Recent studies of micro-celebrity have emphasised the practice of micro-celebrity–engaging in self-promotion and addressing followers as fans–as a calculating self-presentation strategy used by many successful influencers to update their status. In fact, as this study shows, many everyday social media users also perform as a celebrity to promote themselves and others, like rescue cats, without striving for money and their own status. This article reaffirms that the micro-celebrity is an ordinary, somewhat pleasurable experience for everyday social media users, whose selves constantly cross boundaries to build affinity with others, rather than merely presenting the extended self to serve one’s ego. Moreover, this case study of pet Instagram shows that the practice of micro-celebrity on social media as teamwork can affectively, productively, and playfully reaffirm how the self is always part of and constituted by multiple others, including nonhuman animal others. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

An extensive ethical debate has ensued. Aim: To determine the perspectives of South African healthcare workers (HCWs) on the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination passports (C19VPs) in South Africa (SA). Setting: Healthcare workers working in various fields and practice settings throughout SA were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed using convenience sampling via social media platforms to HCWs over a 1-month period, collecting demographic details and responses to 8 Likert-type items regarding agreement with C19VPs, ethical issues and feasibility. Each item was graded from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with grouping of 4 of the 8 items exploring a common theme of C19VPs being a good idea, constituting a score out of 20. Non-parametric tests were performed to determine differences in responses between groups. Results: One thousand HCWs responded to the survey and fulfilled inclusion criteria. The majority (83.2%) of respondents were medical practitioners (MPs). Overall, most (73.5%) respondents agreed that C19VPs are a good idea. Older respondents agreed more strongly than younger respondents (medians 18 and 17, respectively, p = 0.001), and respondents in private practice agreed more strongly than those in state practice (medians 18 and 16, respectively, p = 0.042). The median response was neutral (3) in response to the ethics of C19VPs considering variations in vaccine access and tending towards disagreement (2.5) in disadvantaging poorer people. Most respondents disagreed that vaccine hesitancy would make C19VPs unethical, and responses from provinces with the highest vaccination proportions disagreed more than others with lower vaccination proportion (median 2 compared with 3, p < 0.001). There was uncertainty about the feasibility of C19VPs in SA, with older HCWs, non-students, senior MPs and those who thought C19VPs are a good idea being more likely to consider them feasible. Conclusion: The perspectives of HCWs, mainly MPs, about C19VPs in SA were obtained. Further research should focus on vaccine hesitancy and its factors in HCWs and the effect of C19VPs on restrictions, reduction in transmission and benefits on economies and mental health. Contribution: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first survey data published on the perspectives of South African HCWs on C19VPs in the country. Healthcare workers are trusted influencers of vaccination decisions, and their opinion on vaccination certificates may also influence the South African public’s perception and acceptance thereof. © 2022.

To understand this potential, the article suggests, we need to understand how celebrities are compelled by today’s mediatized communicative ecosystem to perform themselves as ordinary advocates for people-victims. We need to examine how the performative logic that this ecosystem forces into platforms accommodates certain emotional claims to ordinariness and normative-moral claims to advocacy—who is (un)worthy of a place in the victimized people that celebrities should advocate for. The article does so by analyzing two paradigmatically different case studies: Lady Gaga’s legacy-status and Greta Thunberg’s influencer-style performances of celebrity advocacy on Instagram. The analytical discussion leads to contemplating the mediatized populist politics of everyday politics that both perform, despite their differences, and its ambivalent relationship with liberal democracy (centrist moderation and neoliberal consolidation). © The Author(s) 2022."

The most frequently reproduced illnesses have included Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and Tourette Syndrome. It discusses evidence that the recent spate of new-onset, severe tics are a form of Mass Psychogenic Illness facilitated by social media networks (a phenomenon labeled Mass Social Media Induced Illness). It then suggests that many of those self-diagnosed with DID may be manifesting a similar, technologically-facilitated conversion phenomenon. It then explores another explanatory model: that these simulacra of DID and Tourette Syndrome may also arise via a mechanism more closely resembling social media facilitated Factitious Disorder. Similar presentations, of individuals falsifying cancer, have previously been labeled Munchausen’s by Internet. It then proposes an overarching construct, Social Media Associated Abnormal Illness Behavior (SMAAIB), that is agnostic regarding phenomenology. Within this framework, it explores the ways in which de-commodifying attention, connection and care (measured once in appointments and admissions, now in ‘likes’ and ‘shares’) and obtaining a full picture of the patient’s psychological, sociological and cultural grounding can offer deeper understanding and ultimately a path to wellness. © The Author(s) 2022."

More research is warranted into the factors behind Latines’ understanding of nutrition and potential sources of health information that influence dietary behaviors. This study describes the nutrition-related health information shared through YouTube by English-speaking Latine individuals between the ages of 18 and 49. For this content analysis, a cross-sectional study design was used. A four-step search strategy identified eligible YouTube channels and their corresponding video blogs (vlogs): discovery, screening, eligibility, and included. NVivo 1.0 was used to qualitatively code the nutrition-related information. A total of 68 vlogs were identified and reviewed. Five main themes emerged from the data (what vloggers discussed): Nutrition Philosophies, Inaccurate Information, Product Promotion, Recommendations based on the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), and Recommendations not based on the 2020–2025 DGA. Although some of the nutrition-related information shared followed the 2020–2025 DGA, not all information were in line with these guidelines.

This article investigates the consequences of multiple endorsements in an influencer context. We conducted a between-subjects online experiment in which we varied the number of brand endorsements (one, three, seven endorsements) presented by an influencer. Results show that multiple influencer endorsements affect the performance of evaluative persuasion knowledge and subsequent coping behaviors, which in turn negatively affect brand attitude and perceived influencer authenticity.

The perceived similarity with the SMI was examined as a mediator and the role of the shared topic interest with the SMI as a potential moderator. The results indicate that a likely source for political information generated a greater topic fit. The perceived similarity with the source depended on the shared topic interest between the source and the participants.

They also offer influencers, acting as representatives of brands, an opportunity to develop relationships with consumers and through this, shape purchase intentions. Despite this, research is yet to examine how specific media characteristics, namely media richness and media naturalness act to shape the illusory parasocial relationship that forms between the influencer and the influenced as well as how media characteristics impact upon perceptions of authenticity. Media richness relates to the ability of information to change understanding within a specific time interval and media naturalness refers to the degree to which communication incorporates proximity, feedback, facial expression, body language and speech. This study addresses this research gap by examining the salience of the relationships between media richness, media naturalness, perceived authenticity and parasocial interactions. It then examines the relationships between these constructs and purchase intentions. Structural equation modelling and a sample of 221 social media users was employed to examine the interrelationships between constructs. The findings reveal that parasocial interactions were the strongest driver of purchase intent. Media richness had an important role to play in the development of authentic and genuine parasocial interactions. These interactions subsequently play a large role in shaping purchasing behaviours.

Objective. The present article aimed to study ways in which lifestyle YouTubers construct health practices in their videos within the YouTube media culture. Design. We conducted a narrative and visual analysis across a selection of 15 videos. Results. Results showed that YouTubers’ practices and recommendations for a better life were structured around three themes: Eating to live well; Exercising to live well; Resting to live well and, a fourth cross-cutting theme on Practices aimed at self-development to achieve health and happiness. YouTubers were mainly female presenting, as well as middle/upper-class and white appearing. An overall optimistic tone characterised their health stories, as they delivered personal experiences of success on becoming healthy, happy, and better persons, while encouraging viewers to act similarly. Our findings suggested that YouTubers actively contribute to construct unprecedented definitions of health, enhanced by the social media culture and broader societal logics of healthism and postfeminism.

This study explores the role of digital influencer marketing on consumer purchase intention in fashion products. The goal is to investigate the direct and indirect relationships of trustworthiness, expertise, content quality, similarity, para-social interaction, and attitude towards sponsored posts on purchase intention. A mixed-method approach was conducted combining interviews with five digital influencers and a consumer-based survey with a sample of 206 fashion consumers, among them 96.1% were women and 51.5% were between 18 and 31 years old. Results indicate that blog content quality and para-social interaction positively influence purchase intention in fashion brands. Additionally, blog content quality plays a mediating role between trustworthiness and purchase intention. Moreover, consumers’ attitude towards sponsored posts influences directly and positively purchase intention and mediates the relationship between trustworthiness and purchase intention. Consumers’ attitude towards sponsored posts was also found to mediate the relationship between expertise and purchase intention. This study highlights the digital influencers’ marketing characteristics, which affect the fashion consumer purchase intention, enriching the research in this area and providing recommendations for further investigation.

This research attempts to uncover the differences among the said factors regarding the purchase type—product or service. In particular, we studied the opinion of the social media users, who responded to a 20-item online questionnaire hosted by GoogleDocs. The study was conducted in Brazil and included two samples: one formed by customers of a clothing store and another formed by customers of an aesthetics center. Upon data analysis using ANOVA and Structural Equation Modeling, we identified significant differences between the two purchase types. We also observed the biggest influence of e-WOM in both cases. Digital Influencers represent the second most important factor. Finally, social media advertising is only the third factor which affects clothing purchasing decisions but not beauty service.

SMIs use various social media platforms to portray their online persona and, as such, can be considered human brands (Thompson 2006). Given the increase in the numbers of SMIs as well as their ever-growing audiences, it is no wonder that in 2019, the money traditional brands have spent sponsoring SMIs topped $8 billion in net worth and is projected to reach $15 billion in net worth by 2022 (Schomer 2019). This new phenomenon is referred to as influencer marketing (Audrezet et al. 2018), a strategy traditional brands use in which they promote their products via SMIs (i.e., human brands). While being passionate and transparent are identified as two aspects associated with how SMIs manage their authenticity (Audrezet et al. 2019), prior research has not empirically examined whether these authenticity types affect consumer responses. Recently, research has identified three authenticity types that may help explain consumer responses. The specific types of authenticity that were developed are True-to-Self (TTS), True-to-Ideal (TTI), and True-to-Fact (TTF) (Moulard et al. 2020). For the purposes of this study, these three types of authenticity will be applied to the SMI. These three authenticity types can be conceptualized within the context of SMIs. TTS authenticity of an SMI entails that the SMI loves what he/she does and the brands he/she promotes (intrinsic motivation). TTI authenticity entails that the SMI’s content within his/her stories consistently reflects his/her brand essence (i.e., the ideal). TTF authenticity in the SMI context refers to consumers’ perceptions of their honesty, forthrightness, and transparency within their online stories. We use these three types of authenticity to assess their effect on attitudes toward the social media influencer. Thus, this manuscript addresses the following questions: Do influencer ""stories,” which attempt to showcase authentic behavior, positively affect viewer attitudes? Further, what if the stories portrayed by SMIs are not true? Do the lies actually matter? This manuscript examines the relationship of SMI storytelling, authenticity, and attitudes toward the SMIs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Therefore, based on Attribution Theory, this study’s objective is to examine whether consumers perceive celebrities and influencers as distinct categories and if such perceived differences in turn influence consumers’ endorsement responses. This research follows categorizations these different types of endorsers according to two criteria: “source of fame” and “source of income.” (e.g., Evans 2019). Following Attribution theory, since people are aware that influencers’ source of fame and income depend on social media, they will associate influencers’ endorsements on social media with “extrinsic motive” compared to traditional celebrities’ endorsements. Thus, this study argues that while influencers’ endorsement leads to higher perceived fit (Schouten et al. 2020), when previous attitude is controlled, sincerity is the most important predictor to endorsement response or PI, leading higher purchase intention from celebrity’s endorsement. This research conducted three studies to investigates the effects of two different endorsers. Both utilized hypothetical scenario to control previous awareness and attitudes. All studies showed similar results as we predicted. Hierarchical Regression from Study 2 showed sincerity (β = 0.28, t = 3.3, p = 0.001) has stronger impacts on PI than PF (β = 0.20, t = 2.4, p &lt; 0.05). Study 3’s results from mediation analysis of Haye’s (2013) PROCESS v. 3.3. show that while direct effect of endorser type to PI is not significant, indirect effect through sincerity to PI was significant (F(7,102) = 26.757, p = 0.000, R2 = 0.666; β = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.055–0.258), while PF didn’t have significant effect. This research’s contribution is to differentiate between the two different types of endorsers on social media and their impact on consumers’ endorsement responses, based on “source of popularity” and “source of income.” Following three studies, the research argues, based on Attribution Theory, that people discount other attracting factors of endorsers (perceived fit/PF) when they attribute extrinsic motives of endorsers (sincerity/“source of income”) to endorsements. Therefore, this research provides support for the claim that that people have different perceptions of social media influencers compared to traditional celebrities and different endorsement responses in social media due to endorsers’ source of income. For managerial implications, this study hopes to provide guidance on which endorsers companies should sponsor in social media. To provide more justifications of theory and implication, this study proposes to test effects of sincerity when an influencer has other primary or secondary sources of income. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Despite high variations in national criminal laws, US-based social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter play a huge role in enforcing certain social and political standpoints on a global scale. One example being the recent legalization and commercialization of cannabis in various states in the US. Young men with dark, anonymous profiles illegally dealing cannabis on social media are no longer the only visible traders, as today’s marketing of trademarked legal cannabis products also features women influencers, who post images exhibiting light colors, desirable environments, and beautiful landscapes. To understand this diversity, we compared 60 Instagram profiles of illegal Swedish cannabis sellers to 70 US-based cannabis influencers’ Instagram profiles. By applying theories and research from media scholars on influencing, we highlight various changes in the way cannabis is being presented and professionalized by a new group of actors. Our findings show that cannabis influencers on Instagram are changing the stereotypical characteristics of illegal cannabis culture as being almost entirely dominated by men, to one where cannabis is represented as a desirable accessory in certain feminine lifestyles. Influencers’ role in transforming cannabis culture to become more mainstream and acceptable for women could potentially effect cannabis cultures globally, as well as ongoing legalization debates. © The Author(s) 2022."

Nowadays, influencers are employed in a wider variety of fields, notably even B2B marketing, where product choices may occur for pure utilitarian reasons. Hypotheses on the differing relevance of demographic similarity of influencer and consumer as well as factuality of the influencer’s communication style are developed. Thereby, we argue that demographic similarity is more important under hedonic consumption goal conditions, due to more heterogeneous hedonic customer needs. Factuality would be more relevant if the consumption goal is utilitarian, as utilitarian products include more tangible and rational attributes. The hypotheses are tested in two empirical studies, whose results are evaluated by means of structural equation modeling. As travel endorsement is an important but underexplored field of influencer marketing, the underlying scenario is a consumers’ selection of a hotel for (1) a holiday (hedonic consumption goal) or (2) a professional/university seminar (utilitarian consumption goal). The results are to some extent surprising (Smith et al. 2005). Contrary to extant research (e. g. on customer reviews Smith et al. 2005; Grabner-Kräuter and Waiguny 2015) and perhaps human intuition, demographic similarity between influencer and consumer appears to be more important under utilitarian than hedonic conditions. A possible rationale for this finding may be, that also in a utilitarian context, consumer preferences may differ strongly. For example, when choosing a hotel for a professional or educational seminar, consumers may rely more strongly on influencers with an occupation similar to theirs. Moreover, there is no significant difference on the importance of factuality between hedonic and utilitarian conditions. A possible explanation for this finding may be that communication that is more factual could be perceived as more serious and reliable, for both product kinds. Finally, a negative moderating effect of demographic similarity on the impact of perceived factuality was found. This may be rooted in the fact that individuals are more accustomed to emotional encounters in relationships characterized by similarity (McPherson et al. 2001). Overall, the results show that findings from other research areas cannot be transferred one-to one to influencer marketing. This area rather seems to follow its own principles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Specifically in the beauty industry, where products are less tangible, influencers easily bring products to life. This research aims to explore the nature of why individuals choose to follow certain influencers by investigating the beauty influencer industry and the connection between the follower and influencer. The source credibility model may explain the phenomenal success of influencer marketing. The source credibility model relies on the source effect theory, with the influencer as the communication source (Erdogan 1999). In addition to the source credibility model and concept of normal attractiveness, social comparison theory may also explain why consumers follow specific beauty influencers. However, due to the lack of knowledge and limited literature about why consumers follow beauty influencers, an exploratory qualitative research design was deemed appropriate. Following a grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss 1967), the responses to open-ended questions were first read in an attempt to acquire a feel for the data. Next, researchers interpreted the qualitative information and focused on coding the responses based on consistencies across participants’ answers independently. Identified were verified and refined by checking the qualitative data and confirming the interpretations (Glaser and Strauss 1967). Analysis revealed four themes: authenticity, relatability, trustworthiness, and similarity. These concepts reflect the reasons why participants follow their favorite beauty influencers on social media. Defined as clear communication of the intent behind social media posts depicting influencers with branded products, authenticity is expected to impact trustworthiness as well. Relatability, defined as ease of establishing connection due to understanding, indicates the importance of sympathy in the social influencer-follower relationship. Trustworthiness refers to the belief that the influencers will be truthful and open. Similarity or perceived homophily between the influencer and his/her followers is the degree of resemblance (in beliefs, education, social status, etc.). Physical attractiveness was not an important factor for following beauty influencers. This finding provided indirect support for the importance of similarity with and relatability to the influencer, as most people do not meet the stringent, and often unrealistic, beauty standards depicted by media. Overall, the results contribute to the literature on source effectiveness and social media marketing by identifying factors that motivate social media users to follow others on social media. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Despite many benefits of influencer marketing for brands, public policy concerns regarding the covert nature of paid brand endorsements that are masqueraded as unadulterated opinions have risen in the past years (Johnson et al. 2019). Sparking calls for transparency and disclosure of sponsorship information to facilitate the consumers’ ability to differentiate sponsored content from authentic (i.e., non-sponsored) product reviews and editorial content (Veirman and Hudders 2019). Recent guidelines and (self-)regulatory initiatives (e.g., ASA 2018; FTC 2017; IAB 2016) prescribe the disclosure of any commercial relationship between the influencer and the brand in their social media posts. Using automated text analysis (LIWC) on audio-visual branded content, this study explores the role and impact of sponsorship disclosure and message complexity on consumers’ responses. Findings suggest that message complexity and sponsorship disclosure can significantly affect consumers’ tone in their responses. Additionally, sponsorship disclosure significantly affects consumers’ clout. The results also reveal that different levels of message complexity resulted in different levels of consumers’ analytical thinking and clout when posts with or without sponsorship disclosure. This study makes several contributions to the further understanding of the function of disclosures in sponsored Instagram posts as a type of native advertising. The disclosure of sponsorship would generate more confidence for consumers, as it provides information for consumers to arrive at causal explanations for events. However, disclosure of sponsored messages also generates feelings of suspicion and deception for consumers. Our finding further supports previous findings suggesting sponsorship disclosure helps consumer recognize sponsored posts as advertising, and in turn reduce the effectiveness of the persuasive (Evans et al. 2017; Boerman et al. 2017). Moreover, mediums with different levels of message complexity result in different clout levels.

Social media use increased worldwide, as well as in Turkey, during the pandemic, and conspiracy theories/fake news about medical complications of vaccines spread throughout the world. The aim of this study was to identify community interactions related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. Materials and methods: Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. Results: In the pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations received a great deal of reaction. One-way communication between influencers and other users in the network was determined. Conclusions: This study shows the effectiveness and usefulness of large social media data for understanding public opinion on public health and vaccination in Turkey. The current study was completed before the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine in Turkey. We anticipated that social network analysis would help reduce the “infodemic” before administering the vaccine and would also help public health workers act more proactively in this regard. © 2022 The Author(s).

Spontaneously interest in influencer marketing is also increasing. In influencer marketing, reach is important to estimate how many users have seen posts. Hashtags are the one of the most powerful way to increase reach. Specifically micro or nano influencers, whose followers are less than 10,000 followers, are in the spotlight for influencer marketing. Their follower numbers are low, but their reach per posts is high and marketing cost is low. In this study, we reveal the use of hashtags and the relationship between reach rate in nano influencer's posts. We collected 232 nano influencer (1,000-10,000 followers) accounts' meta-data and 113,247 hashtags used in their contents. By using regression analysis, we investigated the relationship between the number of hashtags and reach rate. Then by Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), we investigated the unique hashtags used in the reach rate quarter group.

In-depth interviews with 16 Korean American FTEs who are social media-based, small-business owners in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley revealed that FTEs identified customers, business partners, and social media influencers as their key publics. Findings also revealed that in addition to FTEs’ unique practices of relationship cultivation strategies identified in existing literature (e.g., networking, sharing tasks, being unconditionally supportive, saying win–win or no deal), new strategies (e.g., sharing identity and interest, proactive outreach, and focusing on social over parasocial relationships) were also discovered. FTEs had the essential need for bonding social capital with the supplement of bridging social capital garnered on social media. Findings also showed the transnational nature of structural and relational social capital, as well as the importance of cultural heritage in cognitive social capital.

However, their success depends on consumers' willingness to invest their time, attention and money. Digital influencers have shown prominent effects on consumers in those social commerce platforms. This study, thus, aims to attempt to unravel the role of digital influencers in affecting consumer engagement and purchase behaviour in online social commerce communities. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed approach with a field interview, an online survey and secondary archive data are presented to confirm all the hypotheses. Findings: Several forms of social power from digital influencers (including expert power, informational power, referent power and legitimate reciprocity power) could influence consumer engagement behaviours (including content participation and content creation). Moreover, the two types of consumer engagement behaviours could further influence consumer purchase likelihood in the social commerce community. Research limitations/implications: Several forms of social power from digital influencers (including expert power, informational power, referent power and legitimate reciprocity power) could affect consumer engagement behaviours (including content participation and content creation). Moreover, the two types of consumer engagement behaviours could further affect consumer's purchase expenditure in the social commerce community. Originality/value: This study draws on the theories of social power and social influence and integrates the literature on consumer engagement to explain how digital influencers affect consumer engagement and their purchase behaviour in an online social commerce community. Firstly, this work extends existing studies on the antecedents of consumer engagement in the social commerce communities by considering the role of digital influencers. Secondly, this research advances the theoretical understanding of the influence of digital influencers through a new lens of social power. The findings also contribute to community managers, users who pursue popularity and companies who target business goals. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The analysis is conducted through PoliS, a new resource containing two datasets of political discussions labeled for party and ideological leaning from congressional speeches and social media posts by political influencers. The transfer learning experiments are performed using the transcripts of the congressional speeches to train a model used to predict the political leaning of social media influencers. To evaluate the robustness of the model, the analysis includes a time-lag study of the performance degradation of the transferred model. We find that relatively little social media data (about one hour) is needed to achieve reasonable performance in classification, and that performance does not degrade significantly over time. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This paper describes the implementation of HHU. Participants: The HHU campaign was implemented from the Fall of 2019 through Spring 2020 and during this time there were approximately 15,043 enrolled students at the south eastern U.S. college campus. Methods: The HHU campaign employed print (e.g., banners, posters, and yard signs) and electronic formats (e.g., email, Instagram). We designed the methods across three phases: (1) relationship building and formative research, (2) campaign development, and (3) the Heart Healthy U campaign launch. Results: The HHU encountered challenges when the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or SARS-co-V2) interrupted campus life, however we relied on the electronic formats to reach students during the state-wide lockdown/quarantine mandates. In addition, there were two changes to the HHU health messages. First, we updated the health messages to illustrate that eating healthy and engaging in physical activity supports immune function. Next, we developed new health messages to address effects of physical isolation and anxiety by promoting psychological well-being during this historic public health crisis. Conclusions: We asked whether a multimedia campaign on a college campus could encourage emerging adults to consume fruits and vegetables and engage in physical activity according to the federally-recommended guidelines. It is essential that interventions intended to reach today’s emerging adults be presented in formats that they use (e.g., social media platforms), supported by campus administrators, and endorsed by peer influencers. In conclusion, more intervention studies are needed to counter the unhealthy social norm behaviors common to college campus life that increase heart disease risk, particularly among marginalized populations. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

However, there is scarce research that studies them in depth. Therefore, it is crucial to explore booktokers to understand them better and to assess why they accept and use technologies to generate and share content about books on TikTok. This paper intends to explore the acceptance and use of TikTok to generate and share content about books on this social network as a booktoker. For this, a qualitative methodology of semi-structured interviews with thirteen Latin American booktokers was used. The analysis was developed through a thematic analysis based on the UTAUT2 theory to explain the findings. The results indicated the categories: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, price value, and a new identified category related to the generation of community and networks.

Taking this video as a starting point, I analyze trans beauty influencer Gigi Gorgeous’s early transition vlogs in which she details her experiences with cosmetic surgery. The narrative Gorgeous constructs in these vlogs, I contend, employs transnormative discourses that center an internal struggle with gender dysphoria. However, I complicate this narrative by placing Gorgeous’s vlogs in conversation with Wynn’s vlog where she recounts her own experience with facial feminization surgery, pointing to the external pressures she faces to conform to beauty norms. I contextualize these narratives within the literatures on aesthetic labor and social media influencers to explore how Gorgeous and Wynn’s desires to pass and to be beautiful are informed by their status as highly visible trans women working in the cultural industries. By theorizing passing as labor, I argue that beautification practices such as cosmetic surgery are investments that trans women in the public eye make in the hopes of attaining social and economic capital. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

However, what is meant by the ‘subject’ is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers’ subjectification on TikTok as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers’ short-form TikTok videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on TikTok as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of TikTok for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies. At the same time, it suggests that platforms’ transnational affordances in Global South contexts occur independently to Northcentric frameworks and interpretations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Results revealed that people with enhanced advertising knowledge or with high message involvement led to greater advertising recognition, regardless of the degree of disclosure prominence. While on the other hand, when people’s knowledge of sponsored influencer content was not enhanced or when they were low in message involvement, the prominent disclosure was more effective than the subtle one in improving advertising recognition. Furthermore, recognizing sponsored content elicited resistance, which in turn led to less favourable attitude towards the brand.

Following a cross-sectional survey of 1,601 followers, we performed structural equation modelling to investigate how different types of followers varied according to motivation, information gain, and behaviour change. Whereas followers directly affected (i.e. have suffered from cancer) scored highest for social interaction and expression motivations for following the accounts, indirectly affected followers (i.e. have relatives or friends suffering from cancer) and general interest followers scored higher for perceived information gain and behaviour change induced by following them. Thus, following such social media accounts may help directly affected followers to emotionally cope with their health conditions via expressive, interactive activities and indirectly affected and general interest followers to gain information and adopt healthier behaviours. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This study therefore uses the persuasion knowledge model (PKM) to investigate parents’ responses to influencers’ product placement in YouTube videos, as well as whether this is associated with greater monitoring of children’s social media use and/or more negative evaluations of promoted brands.

It did not take long for influencers to enter the radar of marketers looking for different ways of reaching consumers. Influencer marketing has become one of the most popular tools in marketing communication. The increasing number of brand-influencer collaborations raises the question of whether influencers are as effective as they are thought to be. The effect of influencers on consumers' purchasing behaviour is an important topic in marketing. However, research on this topic is very scarce. Accordingly, this paper aims to investigate the effect of online source credibility and influencer identification on consumers' purchase decisions. An online survey is conducted on 460 participants to achieve this aim. Results show that the perceived trustworthiness of influencers and influencer identification positively affects consumers' purchase decisions. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

This situation highlights the new generations’ increasing interest in short video formats, which are also becoming a new window of communication between companies and consumers. TikTok allows users to create, share, and discover short, user‐generated videos in hopes of attracting viewers. But it is necessary to understand the variables that attract and engage users of these particular social networks. This article analyses the variables of continuance motivation, video sharing behaviour, and video creation capabilities, which allow users to enjoy such networks, and service providers and companies to obtain results from them. The aim is to understand how these variables motivate social media users to return to and spend more time on this video‐sharing platform. This is measured through the stickiness variable. In this context—and due to the particular relevance of the topic—the authors also aim to reveal any potential differences in the behaviour of centennials and millennials when using TikTok. Therefore, a cross‐sectional study was conducted through a questionnaire answered by 2,301 millennials and centennials who use TikTok. The data were analysed through a structural equation model to measure the relevance of each of the variables to stickiness. The results provide guidelines for improving research on video social media platforms, as well as an opportunity to explore the importance of the selected variables to the stickiness variable across different user segments. © 2022 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal)."

The paper further argues that public susceptibility to fake news can be mitigated by building an integrated approach that combines a tripartite strategy from an individual, institutional and platform level. For example, educating the public on digital resilience and enhancing awareness around source credibility can help individuals and institutions reflect on news authenticity and report fake news where possible.

The interactions can be between members or communities and can range from simple conversations between family members and friends to complex interactions that represent the flow of money, information, or power. In our modern digital society, social media platforms present unique opportunities to study social networks through social network analysis (SNA). Social media platforms are usually representative of a specific user group, and Twitter, a microblogging platform, is characterised by the fast distribution of news and often provocative opinions, as well as social mobilizing, which makes it popular for political interactions. The nature of Twitter generates a valuable SNA data source for investigating political conversations and communities, and in related research, specific archetypal conversation patterns between communities were identified that allow for unique interpretations of conversations about a topic. This paper reports on a study where social network analysis (SNA) was performed on Twitter data about political events in 2021 in South Africa. The purpose was to determine which distinct conversation patterns could be detected in datasets collected, as well as what could be derived from these patterns given the South African political landscape and perceptions. The results indicate that conversations in the South African political landscape are less polarized than expected. Conversations often manifest broadcast patterns from key influencers in addition to tight crowds or community clusters. Tight crowds or community clusters indicate intense conversation across communities that exhibits diverse opinions and perspectives on a topic. The results may be of value for researchers that aim to understand social media conversations within the South African society. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

As such, the current content analytical study (N = 1,200 posts, 60 influencers) examined how female health and beauty influencers present themselves in accordance with the superwoman ideal and whether such presentations vary by culture (i.e., the US, Belgium, and China). Inductive framing analysis revealed that they highlight their excellence in six roles, which focus on appearance, relationships, activities, achievements, wisdom, and expertise. Additional multilevel analyses suggested that besides beauty, it is most important to be perceived as an exciting and experienced individual.

Previous studies have examined how social media users perceive the authenticity and credibility of new digital celebrities—influencers—and the impacts on advertising outcomes. Authenticity in media communication has been defined in many ways, but most definitions include factors such as sincerity, trustworthiness, accuracy, originality, and spontaneity. Prior research on authenticity in computermediated communication emphasized the importance of three levels of authenticity, that of the source, of the message, and of the interaction. How social media influencers (SMIs) perceive their own authenticity is an understudied topic. SMIs are simultaneously perceived by their audiences as celebrities, experts, and consumers. Expanding their audiences is one of their goals. Being authentic at the beginning of one’s SMI career as a content creator might be simple, but it becomes much more challenging after one’s audience has grown significantly. Sponsorship can pose a challenge to an SMI’s authenticity. The present study aims to explore the role that authenticity plays for SMIs and develop a theoretical framework for understanding the self‐perceived authenticity of SMIs. For this purpose, in‐depth interviews were conducted with SMIs that have both national and international audiences (N = 20). Sincerity, expertise, uniqueness, commitment to values, mediated realness, visibility, communication style, spontaneity, transparent and creative brand endorsement, commitment to followers, and frequency of interaction are the components of the proposed model. © 2022 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal)."

This is partly due to its impact in contemporary media ecosystems, and its influence in political, social, cultural, and commercial behaviors around the world. Meanwhile, some segments of the population continue to be marginalized by sociotechnical configurations that perpetuate structures of dominance in the digital sphere and on social media platforms. This is the case of immigrants, who often face diverse digital, symbolic, and physical borders that neglect their voice and agency. Thus, the present study aims to explore the creative practices of immigrant tiktokers who have achieved a significant following on this platform. Using a case study approach, we explore four immigrant creator profiles with a following of 17,000 to 500,000 through in-depth interviews and a multimodal content analysis of 252 of their videos to delve into their platformed practices on TikTok. The participants are Latin American immigrant creators living in the US and Spain, identified as part of a larger study on the uses of TikTok by Latinx immigrants in these two countries exploring 53 immigrant creator profiles with more than 10,000 followers. Their practices related to algorithmic (in)visibility, and their unfolding identities including their dig-ital, creative, political, activist, cultural, and national personas are noteworthy, and suggest unique pathways to reclaim agency through social media influence and construct multi-dimensional microcelebrity identities beyond migratory status. © 2022 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal)."

To address this void, the present study examines political videos and their producers on YouTube in an explorative and comparative way for English‐ and German‐speaking YouTube channels. We conducted a content analysis of the five most popular YouTube videos for each of the 20 most successful English‐ and German‐speaking political influencers in 2020. Our analyses show that, although English YouTubers already appear to be more professionalized, similar patterns emerge in both language regions, particularly with regards to increasing efforts to manage microcelebrity status.

The study aimed to examine the mediation role of influencer credibility (IC) and the moderation role of self-esteem in the effects of individuals' parasocial relationships (PSR) with YouTube influencers on their product attitudes (PATs) and purchase intentions (PIs). Design/methodology/approach: The researchers used an online survey to test a sequential mediation model and moderation mediation models using Hayes PROCESS modeling. Findings: The researchers revealed a sequential mediation model that IC and PAT mediate the association between PSR and PI. Individuals who perceived IC to be low were more likely to buy an endorsed product when their self-esteem got lower. When their self-esteem is low, individuals tend to purchase the endorsed products if they have stronger PSR with the influencers. However, they are less likely to buy the endorsed products when their self-esteem gets higher. Originality/value: The study expands the dimensions of IC. The persuasive power of IC and influencer-user relationship was affected by individual differences, namely, self-esteem.

In order to help brands to find suitable micro-influencers as marketing partners, micro-influencer recommendation is regarded as an indispensable part of influencer marketing. However, previous works only focus on modeling the individual image of brands/micro-influencers, which is insufficient to represent the characteristics of brands/micro-influencers over the marketing scenarios. In this case, we propose a micro-influencer ranking joint learning framework which models brands/micro-influencers from the perspective of individual image, target audiences, and cooperation preferences. Specifically, to model accounts&#x0027; individual image, we extract topics information and images semantic information from historical content information, and fuse them to learn the account content representation. We introduce target audiences as a new kind of marketing role into micro-influencer recommendation, in which audiences information of brand/micro-influencer is leveraged to learn the multi-modal account audiences representation. Afterwards, we build the attribute co-occurrence graph network to mine cooperation preferences from social media interaction information. Based on account attributes, the cooperation preferences between brands and micro-influencers are refined to attributes&#x0027; co-occurrence information. The attribute node embeddings learned in the attribute co-occurrence graph network are further utilized to construct the account attribute representation. Finally, the global ranking function is designed to generate ranking scores for all brand-micro-influencer pairs from the three perspectives jointly.

Based on the Gateway Hypothesis, we argue that these online activities may translate into offline participation over time. To test these assumptions, we conducted a two-wave panel study during the national parliamentary elections in Austria with a national quota sample (N T2 = 564). Findings reveal that following political influencers who post about elections or party politics increases online participation, which predicts higher offline participation over time.

This Bitch: Esta Sangre Quiero, written by playwright Adrienne Dawes and performed on Zoom as part of the University of Arkansas virtual ArkType Festival in January 2021, reimagines the role of honor and honra in the early modern court as analogous to the clout or status of influencers which dominant social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube. The delicate balancing act that nobles in comedia must master to navigate between desire and reputation is reflected in Dawes’s adaptation in the juxtaposition of the private selves and the performative selves which influencers display for followers to consume. This article thus explores how this recent adaptation engages with performative identities/identity as performance as a natural through line between the social context of the original play and the self-fashioning practices of today’s rich and (internet) famous. In this version of Lope’s story, the countess Diana becomes a Pilates instructor and pansexual goddess, while the secretary Teodoro is reimagined as her talented, but unknown, social media manager. Although this adaptation was imagined for performance on a traditional theater stage, the social commentary became so much more pointed when examined through the meta-layer of online performance: as we examine the lives of people who mediate their identity via screens using the Zoom screen itself, the audience becomes complicit in the self-fashioning strategies of the characters. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

To take advantage of the vast size of social networks, firms have now turned their attention to influencer marketing wherein they employ independent influencers to promote their products on social media platforms. Despite the recent growth in influencer marketing, the problem of network seeding (i.e., identification of influencers to optimally post a firm's message or advertisement) neither has been rigorously studied in the academic literature nor has been carefully addressed in practice. We develop a data-driven optimization framework to help a firm successfully conduct (i) short-horizon and (ii) long-horizon influencer marketing campaigns, for which two models are developed, respectively, to maximize the firm's benefit. The models are based on the interactions with marketers, observation of firms' message placements on social media, and model parameters estimated via empirical analysis performed on data from Twitter. Our empirical analysis discovers the effects of collective influence of multiple influencers and finds two important parameters to be included in the models, namely, multiple exposure effect and forgetting effect. For the short-horizon campaign, we develop an optimization model to select influencers and present structural properties for the model. Using these properties, we develop a mathematical programming based polynomial time procedure to provide near-optimal solutions. For the long-horizon problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure to simultaneously select influencers and schedule their message postings over a planning horizon. We demonstrate the superiority of our solution strategies for both short- and longhorizon problems against multiple benchmark methods used in practice.

It draws on concepts of diaspora philanthropy, activism and citizenship to understand, firstly, how diasporas might be enabled or hindered, in supporting their communities and then the wider impacts of their crisis responses on processes of social change. Drawing on participant observation, interviews and social media from charitable organisations and leading influencers from the Algerian community in the UK, it explores a wide range of remarkable initiatives to support vulnerable communities, predominantly in London during the pandemic. Motivations and facilitating factors of this solidarity included emerging trust in local elites and leaders, Islamic faith, effective engagement in online spaces and pride in a transnational Algerian identity.

Social media platforms such as Twitter are extensively used to communicate about cancer care, yet little is known about the role of these online platforms in promoting early detection or sharing the lived experiences of patients with CRC. This study tracked Twitter discussions about CRC and characterized participating users to better understand public communication and perceptions of CRC during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tweets containing references to CRC were collected from January 2020 to April 2021 using Twitter's Application Programming Interface. Account metadata was used to predict user demographic information and classify users as either organizations, individuals, clinicians, or influencers. We compared the number of impressions across users and analyzed the content of tweets using natural language processing models to identify prominent topics of discussion. RESULTS: There were 72,229 unique CRC-related tweets by 31,170 users. Most users were male (66%) and older than 40 years (57%). Individuals accounted for most users (44%); organizations (35%); clinicians (19%); and influencers (2%). Influencers made the most median impressions (35,853). Organizations made the most overall impressions (1,067,189,613). Tweets contained the following topics: bereavement (20%), appeals for early detection (20%), research (17%), National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month (15%), screening access (14%), and risk factors (14%). CONCLUSION: Discussions about CRC largely focused on bereavement and early detection. Online coverage of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month and personal experiences with CRC effectively stimulated goaloriented tweets about early detection. Our findings suggest that although Twitter is commonly used for communicating about CRC, partnering with influencers may be an effective strategy for improving communication of future public health recommendations related to CRC. © 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology."

Influencers of a social media network, owing to their massive popularity, provide a huge potential customer base. However, it is not straightforward to decide which influencers should be selected for an advertising campaign that can generate high returns with low investment. In this work, we present an agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate the dynamics of influencer advertising campaigns in a variety of scenarios and can help discover the best influencer marketing strategy. Our system is a probabilistic graph-based model that provides the additional advantage to incorporate real-world factors such as customers' interest in a product, customer behavior, the willingness to pay, a brand's investment cap, influencers' engagement with influence diffusion, and the nature of the product being advertised, viz. luxury and non-luxury. Using customer acquisition cost and conversion ratio as a unit economic, we evaluate the performance of different kinds of influencers under a variety of circumstances that are simulated by varying the nature of the product and the customers' interest. Our results exemplify the circumstance-dependent nature of influencer marketing and provide insights into which kinds of influencers would be a better strategy under respective circumstances. For instance, we show that as the nature of the product varies from luxury to non-luxury, the performance of celebrities declines, whereas the performance of nano-influencers improves. In terms of the customers' interest, we find that the performance of nano-influencers declines with the decrease in customers' interest, whereas the performance of celebrities improves. IEEE"

We employ a case study approach to analyse the techniques used by 13 anti-vaccine influencers to promote vaccine refusal on Instagram for 19 months from January 2020 to July 2021. Our findings reveal that the maternal is strategically invoked in anti-vaccine content by appealing to three interrelated ideal types: the protective mother; the intuitive mother and the doting mother. These portrayals of the maternal are used to encourage vaccine refusal by presenting hegemonic ideals of the ‘good mother’ as one who is natural, holistic and authentic; depicting anti-vaccination as a feminine ideal to which mothers ought to aspire. Authenticity is framed here as a form of embodied expertise, uncorrupted by culture, politics and the medical establishment.

Understanding how young adults interact with existing social media platforms for health might provide insight for future health promotion interventions. Objective: The aim of this study is to describe how young adults interact with different social media platforms for health and health information. Methods: We used a web-based conversation methodology to collect data from 165 young adults aged 18 to 24 years. Participants participated in an extended conversation with moderators and other participants about health and social media. They were prompted to discuss how they find health information, how they use different social media platforms, and how they evaluate the trustworthiness of information. A thematic qualitative analysis was applied to the data. Results: Young adults spent a lot of time scrolling through Facebook newsfeeds, which often resulted in seeing health-related content either from their friends, news sources, or advertisements. Some actively sought out information about specific health areas by joining groups or following relevant pages. YouTube was considered a useful source for learning about everything and was often the go-to when searching for information or advice (after Google). Young adults found the video format easy to learn from. They stated that they could identify accurate YouTube health content by cross-checking multiple videos, by feeling that the presenter was real and relatable, or just through instinctively judging a video’s credibility. Instagram was a source of inspiration for health and wellness from those whose lives were dedicated to healthy lifestyles and fitness. Twitter, Tumblr, and Snapchat were rarely used for health information. Conclusions: Most young adults obtain health information from social media, both actively and through passive exposure. Participants indicated looking to social media influencers for health and lifestyle inspiration and judged the credibility of sources by appearance and instinct. Health experts should try to use the channels in the way that young adults already use them; use relatable role models on Instagram and YouTube, eye-catching headlines and support groups on Facebook, and easy to follow instruction videos via YouTube. © Megan S C Lim, Annika Molenaar, Linda Brennan, Mike Reid, Tracy McCaffrey."

This study investigates how exposure to content created by health professionals, and posted on social media, influences consumers’ attitudes. For this purpose, the collaboration of one relevant nutritionist influencer in Spain has been obtained. The online survey created has provided 4.584 responses, received from followers (from May to June 2019). After applying a partial least squares path modeling approach, the results suggest that trust in the content shared, the perceived credibility of the professional sharing the information and the informative value, determine the strength with which consumers acquire more knowledge about endorsed products, develop a favorable predisposition towards them, prefer them over their options, and modify their behaviour by purchasing them, instead of their usual foods.

In this article, I set out the historical framework in which the social media practitioners known as fashion bloggers and influencers have emerged and developed as relevant players in the field of fashion. I propose a reading of fashion blogging and influencing as a process articulated in four stages between 2000 and 2020. These two decades, marked by a progressive institutionalization of social media practice in the field of fashion, saw the advent of Instagram-based influencers in the second half of the 2010s and their continuing domination of fashion platforms, and TikTok’s rise in relevance in the same field during the early 2020s. I first explore the rise of fashion blogs in the early 2000s and the scholarly debate regarding its characteristics.

However, literature overviews on the information diffusion of Twitter analytics are sparse, especially on the use of continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). This paper examines the following topics: (1) the purposes of studies about information diffusion on Twitter, (2) the methods adopted to model information diffusion on Twitter, (3) the metrics applied, and (4) measures used to determine influencer rankings. We employed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the studies related to information diffusion on Twitter extracted from four digital libraries. In this paper, a two-stage analysis was conducted. First, we implemented a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix software. This approach was applied to select 204 papers after conducting a duplication check and assessing the inclusion– exclusion criteria. At this stage, we mapped the authors’ collaborative networks/collaborators and the evolution of research themes. Second, we analyzed the gap in research themes on the application of CTMC information diffusion on Twitter. Further filtering criteria were applied, and 34 papers were analyzed to identify the research objectives, methods, metrics, and measures used by each researcher. Nonhomogeneous CTMC has never been used in Twitter information diffusion modeling. This finding motivates us to further study nonhomogeneous CTMC as a modeling approach for Twitter information diffusion. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Motivating factors, including entertainment, information seeking, reward and social interaction, are regarded as antecedents of consumers' OLT, as manifested by CIEB dimensions, including consumption, contribution and creation, and subsequently drive consumer engagement with the endorsed brands. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to Malaysian social media users. A total of 263 responses were collected and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the impact of motivational factors on CIEBs. Findings: The results show that the three dimensions of CIEBs can be predicted by different gratifications (information seeking, entertainment, reward and interaction). In addition, two of the CIEB dimensions, consumption and contribution, were found to have a significant positive influence on consumers' engagement with endorsed brands. Practical implications: This study provides insights into how social media influencers (SMIs) could lead to CIEBs by creating entertaining and rewarding content that facilitates social interaction between consumers. SMIs and marketers that encourage consumers to browse, comment and share SMI-created posts will enhance consumer engagement with the endorsed brands, as engagement is driven by the consumption and contribution to SMI-created content. Originality/value: SMI marketing is increasing, and many brands are beginning to rely more on SMIs to promote brands. Yet, there is a dearth of studies that have examined how SMIs play a role in affecting consumers' engagement with endorsed brands. This study contributes to the marketing literature by developing and empirically testing the research model. Results suggest that social interaction, reward and entertainment are key motivational factors that drive CIEBs, which, in turn, foster consumer engagement with endorsed brands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Yet, we know little about the quasi-legal narratives advocated by users. To this aim, we developed a mixed method study of the #deleteuber boycott on Twitter. Our findings suggest that while users advocate both an Uber-specific and a shared mens rea of Uber with sharing economy firms or the tech giants of Silicon Valley, the latter narrative is the most prominent one; its use depends on whether users are part of a lurata of influencers or not. These findings provide a contribution to studies on public affairs that focus on online activism, boycotts in social media and digital advocacy because they increase our understanding of the opaque legal motivations that provoke boycotters. Also, they highlight that social media blurs the boundaries between boycotts directed at the firm from the boycotts arising indirectly due to the shameful acts of the industry or peers. © 2022 The Authors.

Methods: We distributed a retrospective survey via email and social media to parents of children with MMC who were offered both prenatal and postnatal surgery as intervention options. Results: A total of 127 surveys met all inclusion criteria. The majority of responders considered partner's opinion (85%), maternal risks of prenatal surgery (71%), and risk for preterm labor (76%) as influencers. Financially, the costs of childcare (39.4% postnatal, 13.8% prenatal, p = 0.002), relocation (57.6% postnatal, 36.2% prenatal, p = 0.019), and travel (51.5% postnatal, 33% prenatal, p = 0.033) were more influential for the postnatal group while insurance coverage (36.4% postnatal, 68.1% prenatal, p = 0.003) was more influential to the prenatal group.

This type of UGC is purchase-centered. The viewers of the UGC can include both close friends (strong ties) and acquaintances (weak ties). This paper conducted a series of five studies to fill research gaps about the relations between tie strength, purchase intention, and benign envy. The results of the first three studies consistently show that tie strength between the buyer and the viewers positively influences the viewers’ feeling of benign envy, which in turn affects viewers’ purchase intention toward the displayed purchase. Furthermore, two additional experiments identify purchase type as a moderator of the mediation effect. Specifically, benign envy mediates the effect when the purchase is a material one but not an experiential one. These findings not only reveal how the viewers of purchase-centered UGC are influenced by tie strength and benign envy, but also demonstrate the role of purchase type in the effect of purchase-centered UGC.

However, no empirical research is available yet that examines how the influencer’s gender affects the persuasiveness of sponsored content posted by this influencer. Therefore, this paper reports on the results from an experimental study (N = 241) testing whether a sponsored post leads to more engagement and greater brand attitude when endorsed by a male vs. a female influencer, and whether the participants’ gender moderates this effect. The results revealed no main effects of an influencer’s gender, however, an interaction effect was found with participants’ gender. More specific, and in line with social identity theory, results suggest that women perceive themselves to be more similar to the female compared to the male influencer, leading to stronger feelings of parasocial interaction, which in turn positively affect brand attitude and post engagement. For men, no differences were found between a male and female influencer on brand attitude nor post engagement through perceived similarity and parasocial interaction.

This is because politicians increasingly model their public personae on internet celebrities. We substantiate this argument with an analysis of a specific micro-celebrity practice adopted by Italian populist leader, Matteo Salvini: the ‘good morning selfie.’ We argue that Salvini borrows the practice of good morning selfies from social media influencers to build perceived interconnectedness and affective intimacy with his audience of (prospective) constituents.

In one of the first exploratory studies on the topic, we surveyed over one hundred Finnish influencers and investigated the degree to which they engaged with political topics. Our results show that political topics are commonly brought up among Finnish influencers. However, many influencers also deliberately avoid addressing them because they fear what comments and conversations these topics could generate and that they could personally be targeted by aggressive internet commentators.

Many studies have explored the parasocial relationship (PSR) formation between influencers and followers. PSR has not often been weighted against other widely used relationship marketing constructs, despite the multitude of PSR studies. This study developed a research model based on the theory of persuasion, which was constructed to investigate the relative weight of the PSR. The study considered three personal attributes (attitude homophily, physical attractiveness, and social attractiveness) and three characterizations (trustworthiness, perceived expertise, and PSR) as antecedents of purchase intention. Data were collected through a survey of respondents who bought products/services after watching YouTube advertisements made by influencers. The study found that PSR had a significantly positive impact on purchase intentions relative to other characterizations and that PSR was significantly related to the three personal attributes. In addition, PSR formation was significantly influenced by consumers’ perceived influencer types. The survey showed that social media influencer marketing strategies need to be fine-tuned based on personal attributes, characterizations, and influencer types.

Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data collected from social media users in Turkey. The findings of the study suggest that dimensions of TI affect cognitive response and trust differently, which in turn influences visit intention. Second, the expertise and attractiveness of the indirect effect of content on visit intention have been determined, mediated by cognitive response and trust.

However, more research is needed on the specific influencer characteristics driving this success, and the processes responsible for these effects. In this study, we investigated to what extent product-influencer fit and number of followers interact in contributing to positive advertising outcomes and influencer evaluations. Moreover, we investigated to what extent perceived credibility of the influencer and identification with the influencer mediate these relationships. We conducted a 2 (poor vs. good product-influencer fit) X 2 (moderate vs. high number of followers) between-subjects experiment among 432 Dutch Instagram users. Participants were exposed to Instagram posts of health and fitness influencers who endorsed either a protein shake (good-fit) or ice cream (poor-fit). Results showed that fit and number of followers seem to work in tandem: although influencers with a high number of followers are liked more, and their endorsements result in a more positive attitude toward both the ad and product, and a greater likelihood to buy the advertised product as compared to influencers with a moderate number of followers, the endorsed product should fit the influencer’s self-branded image for these positive effects to occur. Moreover, effects were all mediated by perceived credibility and identification, which appear to be important drivers of influencer endorsement effects. Together, our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the processes driving audience responses to influencer marketing, and provide clear guidelines for practitioners. © 2021 The Author(s).

With the breakthrough of social media, microblogging has become an influential medium for marketing fashion brands and products online. The article reports on the findings of a three-year research project that studied ten Irish and ten Chinese fashion microblogging influencers’ blogs using Text Mining and Netnography. The author first designed a digital tool for data mining that allows the simultaneous translation of Chinese microblogs into English and vice-versa, also enabling visualizations of most frequent words through word clouds, and displaying the context in which they were used through collocations. These linguistic and visual translations became the basis to elaborate a typology of blogging strategies. Second, using the metaphor of translation as “the other side of a brocade,” the author compares the strategies followed by the Chinese and the Irish micro-bloggers as if they were the two sides of a single work, given that they are all arranged around the same list of categories. The article thus provides empirical and visual evidence on the use of translation to understand fashion blogging and the values there expressed, across cultures. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Food and beverage brands capitalize on this trend by marketing their products on social media to adolescents. Depending on the nutrition value of the products being marketed, social media advertisements' influence may contribute to the risk of developing unfavorable health outcomes such as obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. This review aimed to investigate social media's food and beverage advertisements' role in influencing adolescents' food choices by appraising published literature. A systematic literature review was conducted reporting on social media's role in adolescents' food choices. Articles were searched through CINAHL and PubMed from scholarly journals between 2015 and 2020, using the search terms: social media use, food advertisements, adolescents, and food choices. Eligible articles were selected based on inclusion criteria. PRISMA guidelines were followed, and study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The analysis was conducted using narrative analysis to identify key findings. Of the 234 records, six articles met inclusion criteria. The studies revealed two major findings: adolescents were more likely to recall unhealthy food and celebrity influence was a common component of the advertisements. This review suggests that food and beverage companies use social media for marketing their products by targeting the adolescent population. The use of celebrities and influencers and the promotion of “unhealthy” products appear to be commonly used tactics. With these findings, healthcare professionals should consider screening adolescents routinely for social media use and current eating habits and educating the adolescents, parents, and families about health risk. Additionally, implementing legislation and policies may be beneficial in preventing this exposure. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The study was conducted on 359 respondents who stated that they used Instagram regularly. Three questionnaire tools were implemented: the Instagram Usage Questionnaire (original tool), the MSEI Multidimensional Self-Esteem Inventory by O'Brien and Epstein, and the Personal Data Sheet (original tool). Significant negative correlations were obtained between self-esteem components: self-control, competence, lovability, identity integration, defensive self-enhancement, frequency, and intensity of social media use. The respondents declared no negative influence of Instagram on their current mental well-being. One group (21.2%) considered the influence beneficial to their mental well-being. Observing others’ Instagram profiles did not influence the activity of (most) users, including changing appearance, lifestyle, or making purchase decisions. Moreover, most respondents declared not making purchase decisions based on Instagram ads. The analysis of differences between purchasing and nonpurchasing groups showed significant discrepancies in these self-esteem components: likability, personal power, and competence. Significant differences regarding physical attractiveness, overall self-esteem, lovability, likability, personal power, competence, and vitality were reported between men who made purchase decisions based on Instagram messages and those who did not. Among women, these differences concerned only defensive self-enhancement. The results confirm that prolonged/frequent use of social media can have a negative impact on self-esteem (including identity integration and self-control). However, a positive impact of Instagram on mental well-being was observed. Following (mostly) acquaintances (not influencers) and not undertaking activity (regarding purchasing decisions of Instagram-advertised products) may indicate emerging changes in society due to the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s)"

Extant research has not yet examined the efficacy of response strategies adopted by influencers when addressing negative comments. This study is to fill the research gap. An online experiment has been conducted among followers of an actual influencer to examine how influencers’ response strategies (i.e. defensive vs. accommodative) to followers’ negative comments (i.e. an objective complaint of product failure vs. a subjective dislike) affect the persuasiveness of influencer-sponsored content. The results of this study reveal that a defensive response harms influencer trustworthiness more than an accommodative response when it concerns a subjective disliking of the endorsed product. This lowered trustworthiness further leads to followers’ decreased perceived product quality and less favourable brand attitudes. When it concerns an objective comment on product failure, an influencer’s defensive response does not differ from accommodative response in affecting influencer trustworthiness. These findings indicate that an accommodative strategy may be an efficient way to cope with a negative follower comment, especially in case of a subjective product disliking. © 2021 Advertising Association."

This study aims to expose the most popular figures of young YouTubers and Instagrammers in the Andean Community, presenting a ranking of content creators based on the reach of their accounts. The methodology employed combines quantitative and qualitative techniques for the collection and analysis of information. Datasheets were used to extract general data on the profile of the influencers and, at a second level, the content published on their accounts was analyzed, with emphasis on the topics addressed and the language used in the publications. The results show the top 10 YouTubers and the top 10 Instagrammers of the Andean Community, where gender equity is observed among the outstanding profiles. As a result of the analysis carried out on these accounts, it is determined that the language most used by the influencers of both platforms is expressive, a finding that coincides with one of the objectives of the influencers, which is to connect with their audience.

However, as the amount of unverified information increases, so too does the challenge in deciding which information to trust. Farmers, when learning about agricultural innovations, have historically relied on in-person advice from traditional ‘experts’, such as agricultural advisers, to inform farm management. As more farmers go online for information, it is not clear whether they are now using digital information to corroborate in-person advice from traditional ‘experts’, or if they are foregoing ‘expert’ advice in preference for peer-generated information. To fill this knowledge gap, we sought to understand how farmers in two contrasting European countries (Hungary and the UK) learnt about sustainable soil innovations and who influenced them to innovate. Through interviews with 82 respondents, we found farmers in both countries regularly used online sources to access soil information; some were prompted to change their soil management by farmer social media ‘influencers’. However, online information and interactions were not usually the main factor influencing farmers to change their practices. Farmers placed most trust in other farmers to learn about new soil practices and were less trusting of traditional ‘experts’, particularly agricultural researchers from academic and government institutions, who they believed were not empathetic towards farmers’ needs. We suggest that some farmers may indeed have had enough of traditional ‘experts’, instead relying more on their own peer networks to learn and innovate. We discuss ways to improve trustworthy knowledge exchange between agricultural stakeholders to increase uptake of sustainable soil management practices, while acknowledging the value of peer influence and online interactions for innovation and trust building. © 2021, The Author(s)."

An eye tracking study (N = 67) and an online experiment (N = 371) reveal that (1) Instagram users seem to be aware of influencer marketing but also make mistakes in identifying it within their Instagram feed, (2) users pay most attention to brand tags in pictures and ‘Paid partnership’ labels and least attention to #ad, and (3) disclosures, brand presence, and influencer type all influence the level of conceptual persuasion knowledge.

Responding to this ongoing trend, this study investigates how fitness YouTube channel attributes and fitness YouTuber attributes influence flow experience, satisfaction, and behavioral intention of YouTubers who work out at home via a fitness YouTube channel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the social media literature and the cognitive appraisal theory, this research formulates a research model that specifies the influence of three dimensions of fitness YouTube channel attributes (i.e., social interaction, information quality, and visual content) and three dimensions of fitness YouTuber attributes (i.e., social attractiveness, physical attractiveness, and attitude homophily) on flow experience, YouTube channel satisfaction, and behavioral intention in the context of YouTube. This study recruited participants in the United States who currently work out via a fitness YouTube channel through three waves of data collection during the COVID-19 era.

The aim was to explore the participants’ moral advertising literacy, namely their evaluations of the fairness and appropriateness of IM. The findings indicate whilst the participants were critical and sceptical towards the practice of IM in general (i.e. their dispositional advertising literacy), they were positively disposed towards specific commercial content emanating from specific influencers, (i.e. their situational literacy), often on the basis of the parasocial relationship that was seen to prevail between influencer and follower.

The current research identified unique consumer motivations for following SMIs on Instagram and examined its association with important consumer behaviour outcomes (i.e. trust towards SMIs’ brand-related posts and frequency of purchasing SMI-recommended brands) as well as materialism. Based on survey data, findings revealed four motivations for following influencers on Instagram–authenticity, consumerism, creative inspiration, and envy–which had varying effects on trust and purchase frequency. Additionally, materialism was a significant individual difference variable that was strongly associated with the four motives, some of which served as key mediators underlying materialism’s impact on purchase behaviour.

As a key sub-task of influencer marketing, micro-influencer recommendation is gaining momentum. However, in influencer marketing campaigns, it is not enough to only consider marketing effectiveness. Towards this end, we propose a concept-based micro-influencer ranking framework, to address the problems of marketing effectiveness and self-development needs for the task of micro-influencer recommendation. Marketing effectiveness is improved by concept-based social media account representation and a micro-influencer ranking function. We conduct social media account representation from the perspective of historical activities and marketing direction. And two adaptive learned metrics, endorsement effect score and micro-influencer influence score, are defined to learn the micro-influencer ranking function. To meet self-development needs, we design a bi-directional concept attention mechanism to focus on brands' and micro-influencers' marketing direction over social media concepts. Interpretable concept-based parameters are utilized to help brands and micro-influencers make marketing decisions. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 1999-2012 IEEE."

Background: As COVID-19 vaccine becomes available worldwide, attention is being directed to community vaccine uptake, to achieve population-wide immunity. A number of factors have been reported to influence vaccine intention. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search of COVID-19 vaccination intention related literature published on or before 31 December 2020 from seven databases was undertaken. Results: Thirty articles were included in this systematic review. Overall COVID-19 vaccination intention during the first year of the pandemic ranged from 27.7% to 93.3%. Findings highlighted that socio-demographic differences, perceptions of risk and susceptibility to COVID-19 and vaccine attributes influenced vaccination intention. Healthcare professionals particularly, nurses have higher vaccine hesitancy reportedly due to concerns regarding vaccine safety and efficacy and mistrust of health authorities. Negative information about COVID-19 vaccines in the social media and low confidence in the health system were associated with lower acceptability among the community. Interestingly, cumulative increase in COVID-19 caseloads of countries over time was not associated with vaccination intention. Conclusions: The significant variability in vaccine intention rates worldwide would hamper efforts to achieve immunity against COVID-19. Nurses’ concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy need to be addressed to increase vaccine acceptance and maximise their influence on vaccination decision in the community. As misinformation through social media negatively impacts vaccination uptake, authoritative and reliable information on vaccine attributes, disease risks and vaccination benefits are needed. Relevance to clinical practice: Concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy including misinformation are important contributors to vaccine hesitancy. Addressing these factors, particularly among nurses who are considered trusted influencers of vaccination decisions in the community is an important strategy for pandemic preparedness. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Such Big Data opens unprecedented opportunities for investigating cognitive phenomena like perception, personality, and information diffusion but requires suitable interpretable frameworks. Since social media data come from users’ minds, worthy candidates for this challenge are cognitive networks, models of cognition giving structure to mental conceptual associations. This work outlines how cognitive network science can open new, quantitative ways for understanding cognition through online media like: (i) reconstructing how users semantically and emotionally frame events with contextual knowledge unavailable to machine learning, (ii) investigating conceptual salience/prominence through knowledge structure in social discourse; (iii) studying users’ personality traits like openness-to-experience, curiosity, and creativity through language in posts; (iv) bridging cognitive/emotional content and social dynamics via multilayer networks comparing the mindsets of influencers and followers. These advancements combine cognitive-, network- and computer science to understand cognitive mechanisms in both digital and real-world settings but come with limitations concerning representativeness, individual variability, and data integration. Such aspects are discussed along with the ethical implications of manipulating sociocognitive data. In the future, reading cognitions through networks and social media can expose cognitive biases amplified by online platforms and relevantly inform policy-making, education, and markets about complex cognitive trends. © 2021 The Authors.

Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) promote destinations through various social media platforms of which Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are common. Of these platforms, Facebook is widely used for promotion, consumer research, and customer service, which makes it the foremost choice of DMOs for destination promotion. In India, the State and Union Territory tourism departments act as DMOs. The study explores how Indian DMOs strategically employ Facebook to promote their destinations. Six months’ data were collected from the Facebook pages of 32 DMOs for content analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven managers of tourism departments. The Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala DMOs have shown high user engagement through firm-generated content (visual content and informative posts). The findings conclude that DMOs are using Facebook as a supplement to traditional marketing tools and rarely for customer service and research. DMOs benefit from the contents of scenic beauty, culture, and cuisine which appeal more to engage users on Facebook pages.

After conducting a text analysis of 150 Twitter accounts by Gulf State leaders and influencers during the years 2017–2018 it was found that while real rapprochement between Israel and many of the Gulf State regimes was discernible, social media discourse remained antagonistic towards Israel. It was found that approximately 25% of the analysed Twitter accounts encourage normalization with Israel, with the majority of support coming from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Following the peace accords between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain in 2020, data from these states show more support for normaliztion.

Therefore, this study explored the relation between exposure to kidfluencers and the purchase of products found in kidfluencer content among a sample of 300 U.S. young adolescents. Results of a survey revealed that tweens’ exposure to kidfluencers is associated with their purchase of kidfluencer-related products through a desire to emulate kidfluencers, and that materialism moderates this relationship. Findings suggest that kidfluencers may propagate a lifestyle to which tweens aspire that may manifest itself in changes to consumer behavior. IMPACT SUMMARY a. Prior State of Knowledge: Exposure to advertising, including sponsored content promoted by social media influencers on social networking sites, has the potential to alter youths‘ consumer behaviors and aspirations of fame, especially for youth high in materialism. b. Novel Contributions: Tweenagers‘ exposure to social media influencers who are themselves kids (kidfluencers) is related to their desire to emulate kidfluencers, which is ultimately related to tweenagers‘ purchase of kidfluencer-sponsored products, but only for those at relatively higher levels of materialism. c. Practical Implications: Parents should be aware of and monitor children‘s kidfluencer exposure. Educators should provide media literacy training that incorporates content related to social media influencers. As new media platforms are created/monetized, policymakers should adapt policies related to marketing to children. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Scholars have examined this topic since Senft introduced it in 2001, shedding light on strategies and practices of popular influencers, as well as the cultural milieu contributing to microcelebrity practices. Missing from the literature, however, is an explanation of how these popular microcelebrities reached their social media influencer status. Thus, through phenomenological interviews with 24 participants in multiple areas of the fitness sector, this study presents a general seven-step process by which these individuals became microcelebrities and leveraged their followings. Three findings are particularly noteworthy. First, a process detailing how influencers reached their status contributes to our theoretical understanding of microcelebrity by offering contextual factors and general steps experienced by influencers. Second, although microcelebrity practices are characterised by intentional self-commodification, most influencers in this study began their careers accidentally. Third, social media may be altering the traditional career paths of fitness professionals, especially as it relates to educations and credentials, which can be substituted with body capital. Future research may utilise this process as a framework to investigate specific influencer strategies over time or at certain career stages, the meaning ascribed to influencers and microcelebrity practices, and influencer motivation related to individual context. Findings also encourage continued examination of social media’s effects on the fitness industry as a whole. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Trust is a vitally important topic in influencer and tourism marketing and is responsible for creating and maintaining successful long-term relationships between organizations and consumers. This study uses customer journey theory to explain the impact of SMI trust on customer travel decision-making and focuses on evaluating the role of customer journey constructs (including desire, information search, evaluating alternatives, purchase decisions, satisfaction and experience sharing) in mediating the interrelation between SMI trust and the dimensions of customer journeys. Using Smart PLS to analyze the data collected, the results indicate that consumer trust in SMIs has a positive effect on each phase of travel decision-making. Moreover, each step of the decision-making journey mediates the trust effect on the next step, having a spillover effect on the whole journey, implying continuous SMI input. Tourism marketers are advised to use SMIs to increase and stimulate the desire to travel as clearly, a means by which consumers search for information about their next journey.

By looking into social media influencer–follower relations, this study suggests that the long-held conventional concept of parasocial relation no longer fully encompasses the evolving contemporary human interactions and related relations. The current analysis recommends an updated notion and theorization—a trans-parasocial relation—to capture a collectively reciprocal, (a)synchronously interactive, and co-created relation between influencers and their captive followers. This trans-parasocial relation concept offers a foundation on which new communicative and advertising theories can be developed to explicate new forms of social interactions and consumer behavior. More importantly, in view of this trans-parasocial relation, assumptions of the existing persuasion theory—that is, the persuasion knowledge model—need to be reassessed. The current findings demonstrate that persuasion knowledge does not always negatively affect advertising outcomes. Instead, followers indicate mostly benign attitudes toward influencer-sponsored posts, interpret influencers’ sponsorship disclosures as genuine and transparent, and internalize disclosure actions as inspiring and admirable. This study further identifies and elucidates several psychological mechanisms that account for followers’ overall appreciation of influencer-sponsored posts: positive bias, verification by cross-validation, and inspirational internalization. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising."

Familiar social media platforms aggregate users’ tastes and reconstitute them as advertising and curated content. In this paper, I show that American cities are induced by state governments to adopt the attention-grabbing tactics of social media influencers. This is particularly evident in cultural planning as it relates to economic development. While this is a global phenomenon, I have chosen to focus on the Capital Region of New York State, a region approximately 240 kilometres north of New York City. I have chosen the Capital Region because New York's nine-year-old system of Regional Economic Development Councils highlights the competitive and often capricious environment that urbanists increasingly find themselves in. Through an analysis of planning documents, reported events and secondary sources I demonstrate how small to medium cities in Upstate New York are competing to be the purveyors of authentic urban living. I then discuss how authenticity and social media interact to create desires for consumption of identity performance. Finally, I compare the city authentic branding regime with the ‘Bilbao effect’ and show how the former can summon the effects of the latter without a ‘star’ architect. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Focusing on the case study of the influencer Chiara Ferragni, in this work I argue that her performance of domesticity and motherhood during the Italian lockdown caused by the novel coronavirus global spread can be understood as an intensification of postfeminist motherhood and domesticity; within a framework of heteronormative institutional marriage and a transnational existence affected by the construction of femininity and motherhood in Italy and in the United States, the two sociocultural milieus that Ferragni navigates. This may favour the tightening of gender roles in the midst of current and future anxieties of social annihilation. This article frames the recent global pandemic, and its attached restrictions of free movement for a large part of the world’s population, as a collective trauma, bringing with it a crisis of meaning and a reconstruction of social categories.

Data analysis from The Guardian has revealed that almost every town centre in England and Wales has declined since 2013, with some towns losing over a fifth of their stores. Factors influencing this demise range from Brexit uncertainty, increased rents and business rates, rising operating costs and an increase in online shopping. The aim of this paper is to explore the cult of celebrity, its deployment within social media, and how this has been central to the rise of online retailing, and ultimately, the decline of the British high street. Celebrity culture and the British high street have both been affected by the meteoric rise of the digital age, which has created a shifting retail landscape. The digital age affects how celebrities are discovered, and how they promote themselves to remain relevant. A new celebrity has been born as ordinary individuals find fame by appearing on reality television. These celebrities remain in the public eye, becoming “influencers,” and promoting fashion brands through their social media. There is a lack of academic research on the credibility of celebrities within social networks. Instagram influencers have affected clothing on the physical high street, by encouraging consumers to shop online. “Fast fashion” can be described as “low-cost clothing collections that mimic current luxury fashion trends.” This type of clothing “helps state deeply held desires among young consumers.” Young consumers follow reality celebrities on social media, and this impacts their purchasing choices. Drawing from an archive at Nottingham Trent University, this paper explores connections between fast fashion, celebrity and social media, and addresses the shifting retail landscape. Social media platforms like Instagram encourage consumers to buy clothing at the click of a button. This raises debates surrounding the implications of instant gratification on the fashion retail landscape. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Influential politicians are those whose messages are readily retweeted (i.e., shared) while politicized influencers are users who retweet politicians’ messages and who themselves receive many retweets. I find that highly retweeted politicized influencers tend not to have formal political affiliations, and so are politically influential but not in an official political capacity. I then relate the Twitter data to electoral outcomes of the 2016 US congressional races. I find that, for richer candidates and incumbents, receiving many retweets is associated with higher vote percentages while, for poorer candidates and challengers, receiving retweets from highly retweeted users is associated with higher vote percentages. Better-off candidates should thus strive to be influential politicians, whereas worse-off candidates should aim to get retweeted by influential users. I argue that the rise of social media begs for a study of what we might call influencer politics, which allows for new empirical investigations into the role that social media play in shaping the democratic process. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

This is because graphic technology has made the sophisticated manipulation of images both possible and easy. After a review of the existing semiotic models and considerations of trust, I am proposing a new approach which emphasizes the value-generating properties of trust by analogy with the money sign, seen as “trust inscribed”. Research from the neurosciences supports the hypothesis that the trustworthiness of the face is judged pre-reflexively and primordially. This, therefore, means that a trustworthy face is a premise for more successful communication than an untrustworthy one, notwithstanding the object of discussion and the cultural context. An example concerning social media influencers serves to show that in the internet-dominated globalizing culture, trustworthy faces are a multipurpose communicative asset that makes a difference. © 2021 University of Tartu Press.

Similarly to the selfies taken by non-violent practitioners of self-capture culture, the jihadist selfie represents an alternative to the Cartesian formulation of a unitary and indivisible self. Rather, it is a product of social relations and performative actions, constituted in dialogue with others through very specific socio-cultural frameworks and expectations. However, unlike its non-violent Doppelgänger, the expectations of this dialogue are centred around a larger political agenda which actively seeks to reformat collective memories of imperial Islamic conquests and co-opt religion as a way to impose a moral order on its violence. Importantly, the battlefield selfie allows the jihadist easily to traverse the boundaries between two seemingly opposing belief systems. Although there exists a wealth of scholarship of self-capture culture, image sharing sites and micro-celebritism, their pervasive influence and practice on battlefield is understudied. This article draws from the personal histories of key Islamic extremists who were both lionized and demonized as a result of their battlefield micro-influencer practices. Today, however, the same individuals can achieve internet fame by participating in self-capture culture - posting selfies, videos or blogging.

However, the academic community has not yet formed a unified understanding of the concrete mechanism. Based on this, this study combines the connotations of meme theory and empathy theory and applies Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to empirically analyze 340 valid samples of Internet celebrity spots visitors to explore the influence mechanism of attributional factors on travel intention. The result shows that mechanism of travel intention can be presented as a psychological model in which travel attribution of tourists to visit Internet celebrity spots is the independent variable, the travel intention is the dependent variable, and the empathy process is the intermediary variable. The influence intensity of internal attribution on affective empathy is higher than that of external attribution, while the influence intensity of external attribution on cognitive empathy has a comparative advantage, and there is a significant difference between them. Empathy process has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between travel attribution and travel intention of tourists to visit Internet celebrity spots, and the mediating effect of affective empathy is significantly greater than that of cognitive empathy. Overall, this study reveals the segmentation elements with strong explanatory power in the behavior of “internet celebrity spots punch in,” examines the practical effect of empathy process in the behavioral intention of traveling, and provides a theoretical reference for the transformation and upgrading of tourist destinations and marketing planning of online communication in the future.

Design: Individual questionnaires based on open-ended questions and group discussions (6-8 participants) were used to address the objectives. Data were analysed using content analysis based on deductive-inductive coding. Setting: Montevideo and its metropolitan area (Uruguay, Latin America). Participants: Totally, 102 adolescents (aged between 11 and 15 years, 52 % female) recruited at two educational institutions. Results: Adolescents reported frequently consuming ultra-processed products and fast food although they were perceived as bad for their health, whereas they reported an infrequent consumption of fruits and vegetables. Multifaceted strategies to promote healthy eating habits emerged from adolescents' accounts, including public awareness campaigns, nutrition education programmes, nutrition label standards and regulations, and changes in food availability and affordability. Conclusions: Results from the present work suggest that co-creation with adolescents may be an effective way to inform the development of strategies to promote healthier eating habits. The strategies suggested by adolescents were mainly focused on behaviour change communication, who emphasised the importance of social media and the involvement of celebrities and influencers.

This shift became more apparent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic; with loneliness on the rise, social media has become the de facto answer to a looming crisis by offering a welcoming virtual community at one’s fingertips. Influencers and individual creators are capitalising on this shift, building businesses and monetising their followings — and brands have the opportunity to do the same with their communities. Gone are the days of finding it strange to pay for social content or ‘chip in’ to a creator — apps like Venmo and Cash App have made it easier than ever to send money in a way that feels like you are simply supporting a friend. This new era of monetising social transactions is not only for the little guys, but big brands have also entered the fray by tapping into micro influencers and leveraging social selling techniques that feel more intimate and personal, even in a digital environment. Readers of the article will gain an understanding of transactional trends that are occurring in the social space. As social platforms continue to evolve it is imperative to understand the impacts to all players to better prepare for the future. © Henry Stewart Publications."

The lockdown restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced young people's access to traditional sources of mental health support. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the online resources young people were using to support their mental health during the first lockdown period in Ireland. It made use of an anonymous online survey targeted at young people aged 18–25. Participants were recruited using ads on social media including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and SnapChat. A total of 393 respondents completed the survey. Many of the respondents indicated that they were using social media (51.4%, 202/393) and mental health apps (32.6%, 128/393) as sources of support. Fewer were making use of formal online resources such as charities (26%, 102/393) or professional counseling services (13.2%, 52/393). Different social media platforms were used for different purposes; Facebook was used for support groups whilst Instagram was used to engage with influencers who focused on mental health issues. Google search, recommendations from peers and prior knowledge of services played a role in how resources were located. Findings from this survey indicate that digital technologies and online resources have an important role to play in supporting young people's mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these digital tool's potential as well as how they can be improved to better meet young people's needs. Copyright © 2021 Pretorius and Coyle."

They are normally provided with free products or services and are paid to post and tag photographs of the services or products on social media. Studies have found that some influencers provide advice concerning nutrition that is incorrect or could harm people if followed. The Australian Food and Beverages Advertising Code and the Australian Consumer Law are relevant regulatory mechanisms that apply to this situation. However, there are some serious gaps within this framework and it is not being sufficiently implemented. The authors argue that there is currently insufficient protection to the public from influencers providing misleading or deceptive nutrition advice and the consequences are serious to the public's health. This is the first article, to the authors' knowledge, to examine this issue in Australia."

In Germany, as in many other countries, people choose social media, including Twitter, to obtain real-time information and understanding of the pandemic and its consequences. Next to authorities, experts such as virologists and science communicators were very prominent at the beginning of German Twitter COVID-19 crisis communication. Objective: The aim of this study was to detect similarities and differences between public authorities and individual experts in COVID-19 crisis communication on Twitter during the first year of the pandemic. Methods: Descriptive analysis and quantitative content analysis were carried out on 8251 original tweets posted from January 1, 2020, to January 15, 2021. COVID-19-related tweets of 21 authorities and 18 experts were categorized into structural, content, and style components. Negative binomial regressions were performed to evaluate tweet spread measured by the retweet and like counts of COVID-19-related tweets. Results: Descriptive statistics revealed that authorities and experts increasingly tweeted about COVID-19 over the period under study. Two experts and one authority were responsible for 70.26% (544,418/774,865) of all retweets, thus representing COVID-19 influencers. Altogether, COVID-19 tweets by experts reached a 7-fold higher rate of retweeting (t8,249=26.94, P&lt;.001) and 13.9 times the like rate (t8,249=31.27, P&lt;.001) compared with those of authorities. Tweets by authorities were much more designed than those by experts, with more structural and content components; for example, 91.99% (4997/5432) of tweets by authorities used hashtags in contrast to only 19.01% (536/2819) of experts' COVID-19 tweets. Multivariate analysis revealed that such structural elements reduce the spread of the tweets, and the incidence rate of retweets for authorities' tweets using hashtags was approximately 0.64 that of tweets without hashtags (Z=-6.92, P&lt;.001). For experts, the effect of hashtags on retweets was insignificant (Z=1.56, P=.12). Conclusions: Twitter data are a powerful information source and suitable for crisis communication in Germany. COVID-19 tweet activity mirrors the development of COVID-19 cases in Germany. Twitter users retweet and like communications regarding COVID-19 by experts more than those delivered by authorities. Tweets have higher coverage for both authorities and experts when they are plain and for authorities when they directly address people. For authorities, it appears that it was difficult to win recognition during COVID-19. For all stakeholders studied, the association between number of followers and number of retweets was highly significantly positive (authorities Z=28.74, P&lt;.001; experts Z=25.99, P&lt;.001). Updated standards might be required for successful crisis communication by authorities. © Larissa S Drescher, Jutta Roosen, Katja Aue, Kerstin Dressel, Wiebke Schär, Anne Götz.

OSHC Professionals are ideally placed to become positive influencers in this setting, although they may require training and support to confidently perform this role. This study piloted a multifaceted intervention strategy to increase OSHC Professional’s confidence and competencies, to support a health promoting OSHC environment with a nutrition and physical activity focus. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. Nineteen OSHC Professionals participated in the study, including a face-to-face workshop, supported by a closed Facebook group and website. Role adequacy (self-confidence) and legitimacy (professional responsibility) were measured pre and post workshop and evaluated using non-parametric statistics. Facebook interactions were monitored, and four participants undertook qualitative exit interviews to discuss their experiences with the intervention. Results: Pre-workshop 68% of participants had not received any OSHC-specific health promotion training. Post-workshop significant improvements in confidence about menu planning, accessing nutrition information, activities and recipes was observed (P < 0.05 for all). A significant improvement was observed in role support and role related training (P < 0.05). A high level of support and interaction was observed between participants on Facebook and the website was reported a useful repository of information. Conclusions: Health promotion training, combined with positive social connections, shared learning experiences, and a website improved OSHC Professionals confidence and capacity to provide a health promoting OSHC environment. Health promotion professional development for OSHC professionals should be mandated as a minimum requirement, and such learning opportunities should be scaffolded with support available through social media interactions and website access. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Influencers thus organize their social world in ways that enable them to justify moving between two contradictory poles of commerciality and authenticity. In this article, we argue that these navigations necessitate ""influencer imaginaries.""This concept was drawn from, first, in-depth interviews with 35 Chilean social media influencers, and second, from participant observation with advertising agencies who hire them. The influencer ""imaginary""sheds light on how individuals experience and justify the commodification of the self and forms of knowledge as subject to valuation in markets when they communicate their brands.

While the former is conceived as an act of seduction and conversion, and the latter through violent rape imaginaries, foregrounding both of these narratives are sexual, gender, and family dynamics that are integral to the fear of demographic change. Building upon these narratives, this study analyzes how influential women in Hindu nationalist and European/North American far-right milieus circulate images, videos, and discourses on social media that depict Muslim men as predatory and violent, targeting Hindu and white girls, respectively. By positioning themselves as the daughters, wives, and mothers of the nation, these far-right female influencers invoke a sense of reproductive urgency, as well as advance claims of the perceived threat of, and safety from, hypersexualized Muslim men. This article illustrates how local ideological narratives of Muslim sexuality are embedded into global Islamophobic tropes of gendered nationalist imaginaries. © 2021 by the author.

However, recent data show a concerning decrease in breast reconstruction in African American women. The purpose of this study was to analyze the inclusion of African American women in social media posts for breast reconstruction, with the premise that this may be a possible contributing factor to decreasing rates of breast reconstruction in this population. Methods: Data from several social media platforms were obtained manually on December 1, 2019. Each image was analyzed using the Fitzpatrick scale as a guide. Results: A total of 2580 photographs were included that met the authors' criteria. Only 172 photographs (6.7 percent) were nonwhite. This study surveyed 543 surgeons, 5 percent of whom were nonwhite. The analysis of the results from the random sample of the top plastic surgery social media influencers showed that only 22 (5 percent) of the photographs uploaded were nonwhite patients. Furthermore, 30 percent of surgeons did not have any photographs of nonwhite patients uploaded. Conclusions: Numerous factors can contribute to the disparity between the growing trend of white patients seeking reconstructive surgery compared to the decreasing trend of African American patients, one of which may be the disparity in their representation in social media, particularly among common platforms and social media influencers. This study highlights the evolving factors that may impair African American breast cancer patients' access to safe, effective breast reconstruction, which must be identified and resolved.

Since the introduction of PrEP and HIVST for the key population groups in Nigeria, government entities and implementing partners have used a range of channels in messaging these essential services across to the target groups—ranging from in-person, social media, television, and radio adverts. Yet, few successes have been documented, thereby necessitating the need to understand the enabling facilitators, barriers to, and communication needs of the KP groups in messaging PrEP and HIVST services in Nigeria. Communicating PrEP and HIVST services will empower the key populations to seek available HIV prevention services and help to increase access to HIV testing services in Nigeria. Methods: This study was a mixed-method cross-sectional design; involving 1169 participants from the key populations in Nigeria. The study used a survey and qualitative exploratory methods (interviews and focus group discussion), to collect data from the participants—MSM, FSWs, and key influencers of the KP groups (health providers, peer educators, HIV program officers). In August 2020, data collection was conducted using an open data kit (ODK). Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 for descriptive statistics, while qualitative data were analyzed using deductive and thematic analysis based on the codebook. Results: The KPs were mainly urban dwellers (77.7%), and the majority of the participants were between 18 to 28 years (89.3%). However, the MSM group was of a younger population compared to the FSWs. A majority completed secondary education (56.1% FSWs and 43.5% MSM). The MSM group showed more tendency to acquire higher education compared to the FSWs. For example, about 51.3% of the MSM group were undergraduates compared to 9.5% of the FSWs. The majority of the KPs were self-employed (56.4% FSWs and 40% MSM). Only about 51% of the KPs were aware of PrEP, with typological variations (39.9% FSWs and 62.3% MSM). MSM group in Lagos (82.5%) were more aware of PrEP services, than 53.1% and 54.5% in A/Ibom (53.1%) and C/River (54.5%). Among the enablers to acquiring PrEP information was the ability of the KPs to network within their communities and on personal relationships. Evidence shows that no single approach influenced the acquisition and use of PrEP information by KPs. Although this proportion varied across the geographic locations, only about 50% of the KPs were aware of HIVST services (40% FSWs and 60% MSM). The factors that enabled the acquisition and use of the prevention commodities were cross-cutting, including a previous or current role as a peer educator, integration of the messages, peer networking, multi-lingual and multi-channel presentation, job aids, and reminders. KPs expressed the need for information on how to take PrEP, eligibility, clarification on differences between PrEP and PEP, clarification on any side effects, for PrEP, price, efficacy, sales point, dosage, available brands. A scale-up of the research across all geopolitical zones and a survey to quantify the prevalence would help understand the dynamics and prioritization of interventions for scaling up PrEP and HIVST services in Nigeria. Conclusions: The study documented barriers and facilitators to the uptake of PrEP and HIVST among key populations in Nigeria. It highlighted that KPs are willing to receive PrEP and HIVST messages. The policy actors should consider the preferences of the KPs and the key influencers in reducing barriers to communication and increasing the uptake of PrEP and HIVST services; ensure it reflects in a tailored communication strategy. Since multi-linguistics and multi-channels of presentation were enablers to acquiring PrEP and HIVST messages, the communications strategy for HIV prevention should incorporate these recommendations and adapt to context-specific approaches for effective messaging. © 2021, The Author(s)."

To ensure widespread vaccination, it is crucial to analyze vaccine willingness and its determinants among physicians, key health care influencers. This study aimed to assess acceptance rate and identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among Thai physicians. Methods: A cross-sectional online-based questionnaire was distributed to all physicians at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during March 31, 2021 to April 30, 2021 in order to assess their attitudes toward receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for vaccine acceptance and refusal as well as predictors of vaccine hesitancy were analyzed by bivariate and multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 705 complete responses were received with 95.6% (n = 675) of physicians expressing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Only one of the 31 physicians (4.4%) who expressed a hesitancy or unwillingness to be vaccinated was a faculty member; the others were physicians-in-training. Approximately one-fifths of physicians surveyed were also not willing to recommend the vaccine to their family members (21.4%, n = 151) or patients (18.7%, n = 132). Using multivariable logistic regression, vaccine hesitancy was independently associated with preference for particular vaccines over the government allocated option, especially for mRNA vaccine (aOR 8.86; 95% CI 1.1–71.54; p = 0.041). Vaccine literacy showed an inverse relationship (aOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.13–0.9; p = 0.029) with vaccine hesitancy. Uncertainty of the vaccine efficacy (83.9%) and fear of adverse events (48.4%) were major concerns contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Conclusion: This study revealed a high rate of physician willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine especially among staffs; however, a significant proportion would not currently suggest vaccination to their families or patients. Restrictions on vaccine choice and vaccine illiteracy, together with concerns over adverse effects and uncertainty of efficacy, were associated with negative attitudes toward vaccination. To raise acceptance of the vaccination program, efforts should be made to balance individual preference for vaccine type in addition to increasing the availability of accurate data on safety and efficacy for each vaccine. © 2021, The Author(s)."

We analyzed more than eight million randomly selected Twitter posts from the first wave of the pandemic to study the role of the author’s social status (Health Expert or Influencer) and the informational novelty of the tweet in the diffusion of several key types of information. Our results show that health-related information and political discourse propagated faster than personal narratives, economy-related or travel-related news. Content novelty further accelerated the spread of these discussion themes. People trusted health experts on health-related knowledge, especially when it was novel, while influencers were more effective at propagating political discourse. Finally, we observed a U-shaped relationship between the informational novelty and the number of retweets. Tweets with average novelty spread the least. Tweets with high novelty propagated the most, primarily when they discussed political, health, or personal information, perhaps owing to the immediacy to mobilize this information. On the other hand, economic and travel-related information spread most when it was less novel, and people resisted sharing such information before it was duly verified. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Instagram is one of the most consolidated social networks focused on the image where citizens interested in educational areas can find information from specialized channels on this topic. The purpose of this study is to analyze, during the period of confinement by COVID-19, the use of Instagram by educational influencers to consolidate their channel in new audiences, influence through interaction with their followers and create their transmedia production. Using a mixed methodological approach, a descriptive analysis of a sample of 810,200 users and a content analysis of 13 profiles of educational influencers is applied. The results show educational influencers as true experts in the use of Instagram, managing visually pleasing and harmonious profiles for new audiences. These influencers reach a large number of users, mostly women between the ages of 25 and 45 with an interest in “motherhood” on the platform. Educational influencers use digital marketing codes in their social networks, with a communicative style adapted to this type of space that seeks to increase the interaction and participation of new audiences and, as a consequence, economic profitability. There is a high number of influencers whose objective is to share educational resources, using their accounts as showcases for their transmedia educational production and for the sale or promotion of their productions and creations. © 2021 by the authors.

Analyzing keywords using a semantic network analysis method revealed the main characteristics of the collections, celebrities, influencers, fashion items, fashion brands, and designers connected with the four fashion weeks. Using topic modeling and a sentiment analysis, this study confirmed that brands that embodied similar themes in terms of topics and had positive sentimental reactions were also most frequently mentioned by the consumers. A semantic network analysis of the tweets showed that social media, influencers, fashion brands, designers, and words related to sustainability and ethics were mentioned in all four cities. In our topic modeling, the classification of the keywords into three topics based on the brand collection’s themes provided the most accurate model. To identify the sentimental evaluation of brands participating in the 2019 F/W Fashion Week, we analyzed the consumers’ sentiments through positive, neutral, and negative reactions.

Recent Findings: Despite its fundamental value as a means of communication and knowledge sharing, social media carries legal, ethical, and professional challenges. Healthcare providers have run into issues such as misinformation, conflicts of interest, and overstepping patient-physician boundaries when using social media. An interesting finding is that dermatologists commonly engage with an online audience through social media marketing or being an influencer to improve business and extend their reach to clients; however, this warrants formal training and the need to monitor their own online presence to prevent legal consequences. Summary: Social media has become integral in everyday life; billions of people now receive information and stay connected with each other through social platforms. Within medicine, social media has enhanced various aspects of healthcare, such as professional networking, patient care, and patient education. In dermatology, social media allows dermatologists to promote their businesses and services through patient testimonials, posting advice on blogs, and networking with a large audience of potential patients. However, having a social media presence must be exercised with care, purpose, and transparency to maximize benefits and minimize harmful consequences. This is especially important when inappropriate social media posts by physicians can be scrutinized for breaching patient confidentiality, violating privacy, financial conflicts of interest, and possibly disseminating incorrect information. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Recent Findings: Recent studies reveal that 80% of patients use the Internet to acquire medical information, yet only 15% of dermatologists employ social media for professional purposes. Use of social media by patients seeking dermatologic care is overlooked among clinicians who are marketing their practices. Summary: Unique advertising niches exist among social media platforms, which must be understood by dermatologists for maximal benefit. Facebook offers the greatest engagement with educational content, YouTube allows dermatologists to demonstrate procedural skills, while the most popular dermatology influencers utilize Instagram for promotion. Ultimately, social media represents an avenue for dermatologists to reach a global audience and garner esteem among physicians and the general public. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Internet availability and decreasing costs of media devices are contributing to an easy access to technology by families. Public health organizations are working to contrast misinformation and promote scientific communication. In this context, a new form of communication is emerging social media influencers. Aim of this study is to evaluate the role of paediatric influencers (PI) in communicating information about children and adolescents’ health. Materials and methods: A group of PI was enrolled from December 2019 to January 2020 by a scientific commission nominated by the Italian Paediatric Society (SIP). PI were asked to share Facebook messages from the official page of the SIP to their own network. Social media tools have been evaluated across 12 months, from July 28, 2019, to July 11, 2020. For the purposes of clarity, we schematically divided the study period as follows: the period of PIs activity (January 6, 2020, to July 11, 2020) and the period when PIs were not yet active (July 28, 2019, to January 4, 2020). Information on Facebook page (lifetime total likes, daily new likes, daily page engaged, daily total reach) and on published post (lifetime post total reach, lifetime post organic reach, lifetime engaged users) were evaluated. Results: A significant increase in Facebook daily new likes, page engagement and total reach, as well as in lifetime post total and organic reach was evidenced. As for PI, they reported a positive experience in most cases. Discussion: In the digital era, communication strategies are becoming more important, so that the scientific community has to be actively involved in social media communication. Our pilot study demonstrated that the recruitment of paediatric influencers has increased communication and interaction of the SIP Facebook page. Conclusion: Our study shows the potential role of influencers: spreading health messages via PI seems to be a successful strategy to promote correct communication about children’s and adolescents’ health. © 2021, The Author(s)."

During the COVID-19 lockdown periods there were reported changes to social media use and health behaviours, and this gave an opportunity to investigate potential relationships. Methods: An explanatory sequential research design of two parts was used: (1) An online survey that assessed social media use in relation to physical activity levels, diet quality and QoL (n = 786; Mage 45.1 ± 19.1 (range 16–88) years; Female =69%); (2) 20 purposive focus groups (n = 69; Mage = 52.88 ± 18.45 years, Female n = 68%) to understand the contextual factors that drive social media use for health-related behaviour change. Descriptive and thematic analysis were conducted. Results: Participants in this study reported that social media facilitated the self-management of behaviours related to physical activity, diet and QoL, through access to information to inform workouts and dietary quality, and the opportunities for interaction with peers, family members and within social groups. Contextual factors including work, home and lifestyle arrangements, pre-existing health-related knowledge and behaviours, and the perceived value of social media for health influenced the relationship between social media use and self-reported outcomes. Social media influencers, peers/family members, and official organisations influenced the application of health-related information accessed via social media. Conclusions: The evidence shows that participants were critical users of social media and were able to use social media to derive benefit for their health and wellbeing. Detailed guidance for those who use social media, as well as those who recommend and endorse social media content is required to maximise the potential of social media to support health behaviours. Future public health strategies and social media interventions should acknowledge diversity in contextual factors driving social media use for health behaviour change. © 2021, The Author(s)."

The goal of this study is to review and analyze the current social media status of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS) on Twitter and create a tag ontology. Design: Tag ontologies are lists of hashtags used to standardize searches within a social media platform. We examined trending terms and influencers on Twitter on the basis of the keyword “MIGS.” We then compiled a list of top hashtags on the basis of the number of tweets from January 2018 to August 2020. Terms were identified with manual Twitter queries and Symplur Signals and selected for inclusion in the ontology on the basis of frequency of use and clinical relevance. The ontology was then categorized by pelvic disease and intervention and reviewed/supplemented by key social media influencers for inclusivity. Setting: N/A Patients: N/A Interventions: N/A Measurements and Main Results: We identified 4550 tweets and 1836 users while searching #MIGS in August 2020. Twenty-nine terms were included in our ontology, which were then subcategorized into 6 groups (uterine pathology, adnexal pathology, menstruation, pelvic pathology, pelvic pain, and other). Conclusion: Our study has created an ontology specific to the MIGS on the basis of Twitter usage over the last 2 years that may facilitate more effective social media communication. © 2021 AAGL"

Social and behavior change (SBC) programs often try to shift drivers of high fertility through multiple channels including mass and social media, as well as community-level group, and interpersonal activities. This study seeks to assist SBC programs to better tailor their efforts by assessing the effects of intermediate determinants of contraceptive use/uptake and by demonstrating their potential impacts on contraceptive use, interpersonal communication with partners, and contraceptive approval. Methods: Data for this study come from a cross-sectional household survey, conducted in the states of Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara in northwestern Nigeria in September 2019, involving 3000 women aged 15 to 49 years with a child under 2 years. Using an ideational framework of behavior that highlights psychosocial influences, mixed effects logistic regression analyses assess associations between ideational factors and family planning outcomes, and post-estimation simulations with regression coefficients model the magnitude of effects for these intermediate determinants. Results: Knowledge, approval of family planning, and social influences, particularly from husbands, were all associated with improved family planning outcomes. Approval of family planning was critical – women who personally approve of family planning were nearly three times more likely to be currently using modern contraception and nearly six times more likely to intend to start use in the next 6 m. Husband’s influence was also critical. Women who had ever talked about family planning with their husbands were three times more likely both to be currently using modern contraception and to intend to start in the next 6 m. Conclusion: SBC programs interested in improving family planning outcomes could potentially achieve large gains in contraceptive use—even without large-scale changes in socio-economic and health services factors—by designing and implementing effective SBC interventions that improve knowledge, encourage spousal/partner communication, and work towards increasing personal approval of family planning. Uncertainty about the time-order of influencers and outcomes however precludes inferences about the existence of causal relationships and the potential for impact from interventions. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Under very simple assumptions the mathematical model suggests that an universal upper bound to follower and followed numbers exists. The theoretical upper bound is then empirically validated by using a representative data set of 255 influencers on Instagram from the field of women’s fashion. The follower numbers show convergence to a common boundary for the years 2018 to 2019 and stagnation for 2019 to 2020, while the number of followed accounts show stagnation for 2018 to 2019 and convergence for 2019 and 2020.

We used a 2 (influencer type: celebrity versus general public) × 2 (sponsorship display status: display versus no display) × 2 (product exposure method: exposure versus no exposure) factorial design. The findings reveal that the social media posts that made consumers most likely to accept a new product were created by a general public influencer and did not include a display of any sponsorship affiliation with the product. Additionally, there was a significant interplay between the influencer type, sponsorship display status, and product exposure method regarding consumers’ acceptance intention toward a new product.

To explicate this theory extension, the researcher applied a multi-method approach to explore a private Facebook group run by Australian social media influencer, Sarah’s Day. The researcher investigates how members use the group to communicate their thoughts, seek support, ask questions, and share critiques of themselves and others. In this case, an influencer who originally fostered connections with followers on YouTube and Instagram built a self-sustaining Facebook group to maintain those relationships through little effort of her own, continually benefiting from follower labor. © The Author(s) 2020."

However, social media influencers’ imagery has not attracted much research attention in either the Western or the Asian context. This study aimed to experimentally investigate the impact of high versus low popular social media influencer images on young Chinese females’ body satisfaction and mood. The participants were 420 female RED users (aged 18–35) who were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) the influencer-high group (idealized imagery alongside high engagement metrics); (2) the influencer-low group (the same idealized imagery adjusted for low engagement metrics); or (3) a control set of nature images. The results revealed that the groups exposed to influencer imagery had lower body satisfaction and more negative mood than the control group (nature images). Notably, this comparison showed no significant difference between the low-influencer and high-influencer groups in body satisfaction and mood. Additionally, this effect was moderated by individuals’ self-discrepancy between personal ideals and their own bodies. That is, exposure to idealized body images does not always produce harmful effects. For those with lower self-discrepancy, idealized body posts somewhat positively affected their body satisfaction.

The authors explore how social media influencers and traditional celebrities are using products within their own social media Instagram posts and how well their perceived endorsement of that product engages their network of followers. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 226,881 posts on Instagram were analyzed using the Inception V3 convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to identify product placement within the Instagram images of 75 of the world's most important social media influencers. The data were used to empirically test the relationships between influencers, product placement and network engagement and efficiency. Findings: Influencers achieved higher network engagement efficiencies than celebrities; however, celebrity reach was important for engagement overall. Specialty influencers, known for their “subject” expertise, achieved better network engagement efficiency for related product categories. The highest level of engagement efficiency was achieved by beauty influencers advocating and promoting cosmetic and beauty products. Practical implications: To maximize engagement and return on investment, manufacturers, retailers and brands must ensure a close fit between the product type and category of influencer promoting a product within their social media posts.

Twitter calls it an authentication sign, not the endorsement, and as per policy, it can be assigned only to the accounts of public interest. Still, it is an aspiration for many users, and many discussions keep happening around it. In this paper, a systematic review of academic and industry literature was done to study the user understanding and aspiration for the blue tick badge, its impact on the users and society at large, and the platform’s policy to award them. Results showed that the blue tick is the “status symbol” for Twitter users, and accounts with this badge are considered elite and influencers. This perception for blue ticks is not sentimental but has been crafted by the platform by keeping its supply low and restricted to famous account owners. Also, the study highlighted that there are no specific and clear guidelines on Twitter’s end for account verification and disproof. As a result, the platform comes at the center of controversy and public ire on several occasions. The results of the study also contribute towards building theory and drawing managerial implications for industry practitioners. This study is unique as no past research has been conducted to deep dive into the blue tick ecosystem, though it is one of the most talked-about topics on the internet. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

However, educational content and peer-to-peer social media influence regarding the topic of neurotoxins has not been studied. Twitter is a social media platform that has emerged as a unique network for public education and for the exchange of ideas among physicians. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify Twitter's top social media influencers on #botox, to describe their characteristics and to relate their social media influence to academic influence. METHODS: Twitter influence scores for the topic search #botox were collected in January 2019 with Right Relevance software. #Botox was the only neurotoxin term with sufficient activity to generate an influencer list. The user accounts associated with top influencers were connected to individual names, identification as a plastic surgeon or dermatologist, board certification status, location, and academic h-index. RESULTS: The top 101 Twitter influencers on #botox are presented. Seventy-five percent of influencers are physically located in the United States. Academic h-index of #botox social media influencers ranged from 0 to 62 (mean, 8.6). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the top #botox social media influencers on Twitter and primarily board-certified or eligible plastic surgeons located in the United States. This study also elucidates the influencer network within which other plastic surgeons and dermatologists can interact to augment their own influence within the social media network. This is the first study to describe social media influencers in this way. Copyright © 2021 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A serial mediation model using survey data (N = 604) indicates SMI-related activities are positively associated with a consumer's happiness. Furthermore, SMI-related activities jointly and positively mediate the relationship between FoMO and happiness.

This work presents an analysis of social media comments data given in response to posts around the connection to the grid of a nuclear plant reactor in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We assessed comments on Facebook posts of local and international media, as well those written in response to a post of a social media influencer. We extracted the main themes and performed sentiment analysis. The results indicate the presence of mixed views towards nuclear energy when focusing on comments on international media’s posts as well as on the social media influencer’s post considered, whilst they were very positive when assessing comments to local media. All in all, nuclear waste and previous nuclear accidents appear to be as the top of the mind; at the same time, solar energy is often suggested in the comments as a viable energy source for the UAE.

However, the scientific quality of the posted information is questionable. Thus, this study aimed to analyze whether exercise and health information posted by popular Brazilian IG influencers has technical-scientific accuracy. A personal IG account was created to identify Brazilian IG profiles. The inclusion criteria of the accounts were: (1) having 50% of all the shared posts related to topics about exercise and health, such as nutrition, health and wellness, medicine, or physical fitness; and (2) having over 100,000 followers. Qualitative analysis revealed a low quality percentage (38.79 ± 25.43%) for all analyzed posts. Out of all the posts, only 13 (~2.7%) cited a reference endorsing the information. Moreover, the higher qualityratio score of the posts was not directly associated with the higher educational qualification of the influencers (r = 0.313; p = 0.076). Nevertheless, the number of followers was inversely correlated with the educational qualification of the influencers (r = −0.450; p = 0.009), but not with the quality-ratio score of the posts (r = −0.178 p = 0.322). We conclude that prominent Brazilian IG influencers disseminate low-quality information about exercise and health, contributing to the wide-spreading of misinformation to millions of followers. © 2021 by the authors.

The international code for marketing breast milk substitute stipulates standards for marketing practices of these products. In Latin America there are local variations of marketing practices. Novel marketing strategies such as advertising through social media and influencers pose new threats for breastfeeding success in Latin America. This review aims to examine variations in local regulations for marketing of infant formulae and to analyze the emerging phenomenon of influencer advertising. We reviewed the local norms for Latin American countries and examined differences and possible gaps. Emerging evidence of influencer marketing was explored. The results indicate that national regulations differ among Latin American countries, particularly with respect to product labelling and the requirement to use a local native language, highlighting the cost of the product, and different regulations prohibiting certain messages and illustrations. Regarding new marketing strategies, there is limited evidence on advertising infant formula through social media influencers, where different categories of marketing strategies can be described.

A key issue is to identify an appropriate set of influencers within a social network, investing resources to get them to adopt a product. Influence maximization is an optimization problem that aims at finding a small set of users that maximize the spread of influence in a social network. In this paper we propose an influence maximization algorithm, named Weighted Artificial Bee Colony (WABC), that is based on a bio-inspired technique for identifying a subset of users which maximizes the spread. The proposed algorithm has been applied to a case study that analyzes the propagation of information among Twitter users during the Constitutional Referendum held in Italy in 2016. Our analysis is aimed at identifying the main influencers of the yes and no factions, and deriving the main information diffusion strategies of each faction during the political campaign. WABC outperformed ranking-proxy techniques based on classical centrality measures, i.e., PageRank, Rank and Degree. Even compared to DIRIE, which exploits a more complex algorithm, WABC was able to find a more accurate set of users which allows to maximize the spread in almost all the considered configurations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Methods and Materials: Using 2 commercial hashtag analytics platforms, 1000 of the most recent eligible posts from each platform were evaluated for content, tone, and engagement, as well as user (poster) characteristics. Inclusion criteria were as follows: unique posts, written in English, relevant to human cancer treatment, and containing 1 of 11 predetermined hashtags (#radiation, #radiotherapy, #radiationtherapy, #radiationoncology, #radonc, #radiationtherapist #radiationtreatment, #medphys, #cyberknife, #radiosurgery, #protontherapy). Results: Users of radiation oncology content on Instagram were primarily patients/caregivers (47%), specifically adult patients (94%) with breast cancer (53%). Patient/caregiver content was focused on patient experience (79%), with approximately half specific to radiation therapy (51%), and most patient/caregiver posts demonstrated a positive tone (86%). In contrast, Twitter content was dominated by health care professionals (53%), specifically within radiation oncology (90% of unique users). Health care professional content was focused on colleague education/research dissemination (53%), with a high proportion of posts specific to radiation therapy (95%). Conclusions: Given the disproportionate number of patients versus radiation oncology professionals active on Instagram versus Twitter, and the lack of radiation therapy-specific content on Instagram, there may be an opportunity to improve patient outreach and education by promoting the presence of radiation oncologists on Instagram. © 2021 American Society for Radiation Oncology"

Three experiments were carried out to test the hypotheses across different contexts. The study findings reveal that low-construal messages posted by the nanoinfluencer are viewed as more credible than high-construal messages. Furthermore, message valence moderates this relationship, such that positively framed low-construal messages are perceived as more credible than negatively framed low-construal messages, which affects consumers’ behavioral intentions.

Rather than political deepfakes, we use a non-political deepfake of a social media influencer as the stimulus, with an educational and a deceptive condition. We find that individuals are more likely to perceive the deepfake claim to be true when informative cues are missing along with the deepfake (compared to when they are present). Also, individuals are more likely to share deepfakes when they consider the fabricated claim to be accurate. Moreover, we find that cognitive ability plays a moderating role such that when informative cues are present (educational condition), individuals with high cognitive ability are less trustful of deepfake claims. Unexpectedly, when the informative cues are missing (deceptive condition), these individuals are more likely to consider the claim to be true and share them.

Quite often, however, they also pose moral problems. This article examines how often public relations practitioners encounter moral issues in their day-to-day work, how they assess digital communication tools and practices in terms of ethics, and the resources on which they rely to tackle moral challenges. Four research questions were addressed in an online survey among 2,324 practitioners who work in PR departments of organisations or in PR agencies across Europe. Results show that PR practitioners face more moral challenges in their daily work than they have faced in the past. Regarding digital communication tools and practices, they report moral concerns especially related to using bots, exploiting personal data for big-data analyses, paying social media influencers, and using sponsored content. Personal values and beliefs are the most important resource for dealing with moral issues—whether because only a minority of practitioners has participated in any formal ethics training within the past three years, or because existing ethical guidelines are outdated. Results call for the development of ethical guidelines that can provide explicit advice in the area of digital communication. Furthermore, structured training programs and ethics courses in graduate programs are needed to enhance practitioners’ ethical knowledge. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

This paper analyzes and explicates the socio-cultural meanings in the interaction processes of the crisis publics with a specific socio-political context by blending the concept of Internet trolling into predominant crisis communication theories (i.e. social-mediated crisis communication and regenerative crisis model). Using cultural discourse analysis (CuDA), we analyzed the top influential posts, comments and responses created by both influential social media users and general followers based on the five discourse hubs or radiants of identity, relation, action, dwelling, and emotion in the Lancôme case, which was regarded as the most heated crisis in Hong Kong after and influenced by the Umbrella Movement. The findings suggest that the motivations and behaviors found within each of the crisis publics––influencers and followers––are fundamentally different from each other by nature along the situated regenerative crisis. Two types of social media influencers (i.e. primary and secondary influencers) were identified. We propose a regenerative crisis model of publics to highlight their roles, purposes, behaviors, interaction processes, and emotions within a situated socio-political tension. This paper also discusses the theoretical implications for social-mediated crisis communication literature and the practical implications that take contextual factors into consideration. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

Considering this, the increasing importance of a positive overall brand experience along all brand touch points has resulted in a parallel increase in the importance of how employees can live the brand. Corporate influencers, an area of study that is to date underresearched, could be a vehicle to authentically bring a brand’s identity closer not only to customers but also to employees. Therefore, our research focuses on the question of how a corporate influencer expresses the positioning of a corporate brand to internal audiences. To gain a deeper understanding of the instruments and tactics of an impactful corporate influencer, we chose an in-depth case study approach. We selected Pawel Dillinger, an informal corporate influencer of the German telecommunication brand Deutsche Telekom, and deeply analyzed his use of an internal social media platform to promote the corporate brand. Our research presents content categories and communication styles, underpins the role of authenticity in internal brand management, and illustrates how a brand ambassador contributes to the enacting of the values of a corporate brand.

Dynamics of self-branding, celebrification and audience interactivity now govern modes of production on and beyond social media. Persona construction and performance in networked media environments increases visibility and reach, with followers, clicks, shares and likes, the markers of professional success. While British newspapers have a long tradition of high-profile columnists from across media and political spheres, the complexities of networked practices as part of globalised news and politics have transformed structure and agency. Lines are blurred between ‘social media influencer’, ‘celebrity’, ‘journalist’ and ‘political activist’ and this comparative case study uses mixed methods to analyse the work of two leading figures who embody such changes. First, it highlights how production practices intertwine the multimedia techniques of digital-first microcelebrities with the newsgathering methods and discourses of print and broadcast journalism. Second, it examines how performances negotiate displays of authenticity, authority and ‘attack’ to construct self-identities and political commentaries that resonate with followers/audiences and then channel them towards action. Finally, it demonstrates that their work reflects the hallmarks of spectacle and considers commercial and political purposes and impacts on journalism’s place in deliberative democracies. © The Author(s) 2020."

Posting images with a consistent concept on social media helps customers recognize, remember, and consider brands. This strategy is known as brand concept consistency in marketing literature. Consequently, brands spend immense manpower and financial resources in choosing which images to post or repost. Therefore, automatically recommending images with a consistent brand concept is a necessary task for social media marketing. In this paper, we propose a content-based recommendation system that learns the concept of brands and recommends images that are coherent with the brand. Specifically, brand representation is performed from the brand posts on social media. Existing methods rely on visual features extracted by pre-trained neural networks, which can represent objects in the image but not the style of the image. To bridge this gap, a framework using both object and style vectors as input is proposed to learn the brand representation. In addition, we show that the proposed method can not only be applied to brands but also be applied to influencers. We collected a new Instagram influencer dataset, consisting of 616 influencers and about 1 million images, which can greatly benefit future research in this area. The experimental results on two large-scale Instagram datasets show the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 ACM."

Despite its importance, no measurement scale currently exists for perceived authenticity of social media influencers (PASMIs). This prevents practitioners from effectively assessing consumers' perceptions of an influencer's authenticity prior to a potential partnership. To provide better guidance, this research develops and validates a scale of PASMI as well as examines the relationships between the underlying dimensions of the scale and key consumer behavior variables. Design/methodology/approach: The current research consists of two studies: the first study constructs a scale; the second validates it. In Study 1, items were generated from existing scales as well as from qualitative responses. These items were revised based on feedback provided by an independent group of reviewers. Furthermore, an online survey was conducted to purify the items. In Study 2, the scale was validated with a new sample. Findings: Results suggest that perceived SMI authenticity is a multidimensional construct consisting of sincerity, truthful endorsements, visibility, expertise and uniqueness. Each of the five dimensions has varying effects on consumers' evaluation of an SMI, willingness to follow an SMI, and intention to purchase products that SMIs recommend. Originality/value: This research extends theoretical work on authenticity by developing and validating a scale as well as delving into the construct of perceived SMI authenticity. Practical implications are provided for marketers and SMIs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

AIMS AND METHODS: High school adolescents (n = 928, 15-18) were recruited by Lightspeed Health for an online experiment and randomized to view an Instagram post with or without e-cigarette use. Outcomes were positive and negative perceptions (prototypes), social distance, and willingness to use. RESULTS: Half (50%) of participants were susceptible to e-cigarette use. E-cigarettes shown (vs. not) led to less positive prototypes, p = .017, more negative prototypes, p = .004, and more social distance, p < .001. Negative prototypes and social distance were moderated by susceptibility (both p < .05); effects among non-susceptible adolescents only. Showing e-cigarettes did not impact willingness to use if offered. CONCLUSIONS: Negative perceptions of e-cigarettes use challenge assumptions that vaping online is universally admirable. Highlighting unfavorable opinions of vaping or negative impacts for adolescents' social image are potential strategies for tobacco counter-marketing. IMPLICATIONS: Despite daily use of visual-based social media by most adolescents, little is known about the influence of e-cigarette use among young people online. Adolescent negative perceptions and desired distance from non-influencers using e-cigarettes on Instagram indicate digital e-cigarette portrayals are not universally accepted. Negative impacts for adolescents' social image present a counter-marketing strategy. © The Author(s) 2021.

Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical lens was a framework of seven evidence-based social influence heuristics (reciprocity, social proof, consistency, scarcity, liking, authority and unity). For the methodological lens, a qualitative case study approach was applied to a purposeful sample of 6 SMIs and 15 videos on YouTube. Findings: The evidence shows that self-promotional influencer marketing in long-form video content is relatable to all seven heuristics and shows signs of high elaboration, innovativeness and skillfulness. Research limitations/implications: The study reveals that a heuristic-based account of self-promotional influencer marketing in long-form video content can greatly contribute to the understanding of how various well-established marketing concepts (e.g. source attractivity) might be expressed in real-world communications and behaviors. Based on this improved, in-depth understanding, current research efforts, such as experimental studies using one video with a more or less arbitrary influencer and pre-post measure, are advised to explore research questions via designs that account for the observed subtle and complex nature of real-world influencer marketing in long-form video content. Practical implications: This structured account of skillful and creative marketing can be used as educational and instructive material for influencer marketing practitioners to enhance their creativity, for consumers to increase their marketing literacy and for policymakers to rethink policies for influencer marketing. Originality/value: Prior research has created a body of knowledge on influencer marketing. However, a conceptual disconnect has hampered the advancement of the field. The social influence heuristics framework is a highly functional conceptual bridge that links the qualitative and quantitative evidence and will advance the understanding of influencer marketing more effectively. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This also means they are easily polarized, not only ideologically but also in their actions. Affective polarization is the emotional tendency for people to show animosity toward opposing partisans while seeking homogeneity from fellow partisans. Much research into online affective polarization has focused on quantifying anxiety at an individual level while neglecting that on a collective basis. Therefore, this paper examined the polarization of collective anxiety in topic-based communities on Weibo. Methods: We aim to interpret correlations between collective anxiety online and topic characteristics, user competence, as well as the proportion of influencers of Weibo topic-based communities. Our neural networks model and statistical analysis were based on 200 communities with 403,380 personal accounts and 1,012,830 messages. Results: Collective anxiety levels are correlated to (1) the extent to which a topic captures public interest, (2) how community members articulate topics on social network platforms, and (3) the ratio of influencers in the community. Specifically, people’s conflicting perceptions and articulations of topics might increase collective anxiety, while the extent to which a topic is of the public interest and the number of influencers engaged in a topic account for any decline in its ranking. Furthermore, familiarity with a topic does not help predict collective anxiety levels. There are no significant links between community size or interactivity dynamics and the level of collective anxiety in the topic-based community. Our computational model has 85.00% precision and 87.00% recall. Conclusion: This study found the collective anxiety augment due to topic proximities to public interest and members’ lack of declarative knowledge on topics, while to decline with an increasing portion of online influencers. These findings indicate that collective anxiety is induced due to a lack of credibility. Also, the amount of conflicting information shared by different people places them in a state of flux. Therefore, a community with more influencers may be more likely to experience anxiety polarization, bringing forth the issue of layered information and inequality. © Copyright © 2021 Yang, Ta, Li, Jiao, Hu and Li."

Main results. The influencers’ posts, according to the macro-speeches adopted, have different features. The low-carb conception is an emancipatory discourse; low-carb conduction, a traditional marketing discourse; and the anti-low-carb strategy, a consumer resistance speech. Theoretical/methodological contributions. The three macro-speeches form a conceptual model from which affirmative and confrontational discourses define the low-carb philosophy authenticity.

Based on a key mechanism proposed by the entertainment overcoming resistance model, long-term parasocial relationships (PSRs) should reduce the amount of persuasive resistance in the forms of reactance and counterarguing. Consequently, the persuasive effects should be enhanced. To empirically test these assumptions, two online studies were conducted. The first experimental study (N = 151) confirmed that followers experienced stronger PSRs than did nonfollowers, which resulted in higher perceived source trustworthiness and reduced levels of both perceived freedom threat and counterarguing after exposure to a sponsored Instagram post. The second study (N = 225) further confirmed the enhanced persuasive impact of PSRs in terms of brand evaluations and behavioral intentions.

The purpose of this article was to review the published literature on influencer marketing, conduct a content analysis of the academic literature, and furnish a classification based on different parameters. The content analysis led to a distribution of articles as per eight different categories. This article provided the first such literature review of influencer marketing literature for the period from 2008 – 2019 to analyze and present the trends of this new marketing tactic, industries and fields involved, different platforms of social media used, key areas and methods employed by the social media influencers to connect with their followers, and spread a brand message. It was found that the major focus areas and industries utilizing social media influencers (SMIs) for brand messages and engagement of the digital consumers are lifestyles, fashion, and beauty. Empirical research was found to be predominant during the period under study. The most popular issues in the recent studies were self-presentation, para-social interactions, para-social relationships, and the credibility of the SMIs. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

We conducted topic modelling (n = 36,715 tweets) and longitudinal social network analysis (n = 17,834 tweets) of probiotic chatter on Twitter from 2009-17. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to build the topic models and network analysis tool Gephi for building yearly graphs. We identified the top 10 topics of probiotics-related communication on Twitter and a constant rise in communication activity. However the number of communities grew consistently to peak in 2014 before dipping and levelling off by 2017. While several probiotics industry actors appeared and disappeared during this period, the influence of one specific actor rose from a hub initially to an authority in the latter years. With multi-brand advertising and probiotics promotions mostly occupying the Twitter chatter, scientists, journalists, or policymakers exerted minimal influence in these communities. Consistent with previous research, we find that probiotics- related content on social media veers towards promotions and benefits. Probiotic industry actors maintain consistent presence on Twitter while transitioning from hubs to authorities over time; scientific entities assume an authoritative role without much engagement. The involvement of scientific, journalistic or regulatory stakeholders will help create a balanced informational environment surrounding probiotic products. © 2021 Vijaykumar et al."

Companies building online content communities to implement community marketing and influencer marketing has become a new corporate strategy, especially in the tourism and hotel industries in which experiential products are sold. However, based on the content community, maintaining the sustainable development of a consumer advice network composed of opinion leaders and consumers is a major challenge. This paper selects the travel content community of Qunar.com as the research object to study the role of opinion leaders in the sustainable development of corporate-led consumer advice networks (CANs). Empirical evidence based on network evolution data from 1356 “Hotel Sleep Testers” across 11 years shows that: (1) the creation and provision of information can obviously increase the probability of the relationship construction and increase the number of relationships, thus facilitating the formation of opinion leadership (OL); (2) active participation in interactions and withhigh-quality information brings greater effects; (3) the network structure variables, such as preferential attachment, structural equivalence, and similarity, can also better predict the probability of a potential relationship; and (4) reciprocity in consumer advice networks has no significant impact on the establishment of network relationships. © 2021 by the authors.

An experimental design with two transgression scenarios (influencer vs. brand) was created, and 250 individuals were recruited to participate in the study. The results show that a perceived betrayal by a brand can negatively affect the perceived coolness of the social media influencer that has endorsed the brand, as well as the parasocial relationships that followers have with the influencer. Accordingly, a perceived betrayal by a social media influencer can negatively affect attitudes, trust and purchase intentions toward a brand that the influencer has endorsed. The current research helps in understanding brand and influencer transgressions and highlights the fact that both influencers and brands should have a sense of collaboration responsibility. It also introduces the concept of influencer coolness, understood here as a desirable success factor for social media influencers, which partly explains their desirability and influence, and a feature that can be endangered through both influencer and brand betrayals. © 2021 The Authors"

Social media, especially Twitter, provides a unique forum and platform for the public to access and share information about this topic. Objective: This study aims to better understand how the public is framing, sharing, and using research about ACEs on Twitter and to examine the information being commonly discussed about ACEs. Method: We obtained tweets on the topics of ACEs, childhood resilience, and childhood trauma between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. This timeframe was determined based on key related events in the mainstream media. Crimson Hexagon, a social media analytics system using Boolean logic, was used to identify salient topics, influencers, and conduct a content analysis. Results: A total of 195,816 relevant tweets were obtained from our search. The weekly volume was approximately 1,864 tweets. Key topics included general use of the term ACEs (23%), trauma and ACEs (19%), long-term impact of ACEs (12%), preventing ACEs (11%), short-term effects of ACEs (8%), the 1997 ACE Study (5%), and students with ACEs (5%). The top two sentiments were fear and joy. Top conversation influencers included pediatricians, child health advocacy organizations, California’s state government, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Public Radio. Conclusion: This analysis provides insight to the ways the public is conversing about ACEs and related topics. Results indicated that conversations focus on increasing awareness of ACEs by content experts and public health organizations.

As social media influences public opinion on medical treatment, this study analyzes Twitter conversations to elucidate social media’s depiction of transradial access as a neurointerventional tool. Materials and methods: Twitter hashtags #RadialFirst and #RadialForNeuro were evaluated using a mixed-method analysis of quantitative social media metrics and qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Between January 2015 and April 2020, 104,146 tweets from 141 countries employed the hashtag #RadialFirst (2015 (1); 2016 (0); 2017 (22,804); 2018 (33,074); 2019 (38,352); 2020 (9,915 January-April)). These generated 226,909,374 impressions and were retweeted 80,120 times by 13,707 users. Media was present in 62.5% of tweets (e.g. wrist image, angiographic runs) but only 14.5% had a reference article. Physicians authored 70.8% of tweets; interventional cardiologists accounted for 83% of top 100 influencers. #RadialForNeuro is more nascent (6 posts in 2019; 323 posts January–April 2020), with 392,662 impressions, and 254 retweets by 177 users; physicians authored 35.6%. Compared to #RadialFirst, #RadialforNeuro tweets were more likely to include media (76%), less likely to include citations (9.7%), and more likely to discuss complications and troubleshooting techniques. Conclusion: Twitter activity regarding transradial access permits information dissemination and discussion on approach benefits and challenges. However, many posts arise from non-physician sources and lack links to peer-reviewed publication. The public should be mindful that tweets may reflect opinions, rather than experience or scientific evidence. © The Author(s) 2021."

It examines how mobile social media acts as an interface between culture and commerce. We situate this interface within a larger political economic context in which tech companies are embracing ‘fintech’ to drive growth. We argue that mobile social media platforms play a unique role in monetising personal data and context awareness through their development of ‘transactional affordance’ – a term we develop to understand new features allowing users to connect content to forms of payment. We argue that the success of these affordances is tied to labour associated with the ‘performative authenticity’ of social-media influencers. Our first case study examines the recent development of ‘shopping’ and ‘checkout’ features on Instagram, and the significance of this feature for the economic growth of parent company Facebook. We then look at how the specific development of augmented reality features on Snapchat serve as the basis for new transactional affordances in everyday contexts. We conclude the paper by arguing that the contextual commerce these phenomena entail signals a shift to a transactional culture in which everyday interactions become opportunities for consumption. © The Author(s) 2021."

Further, the objective is to show how consumer influencers on YouTube adapt to the flexible persona of the online warm expert (OWE) which expands the concept of the ‘warm expert’ from the domestication literature (Bakardjieva, 2005, Internet Society: The Internet in Everyday Life. London: Sage Publications). I argue that the OWE and unboxing discourse advance corporate interests of surveillance capitalism in home environments by promoting the circulation of emergent consumer technologies and eschewing meaningful discussion of privacy and surveillance issues. A case study of the Amazon Echo smart speaker and Alexa, its voice-activated personal assistant, is presented. The research consists of a qualitative thematic analysis of unboxing videos (N = 73) and viewer comments on YouTube. Unboxing discourse reflects normative consumer culture values that are detached from critical discussions of surveillance or the informational privacy framework of end-user agreements. As a practical implication, the study helps look beyond the household and traditional social relationships in the domestic sphere to understand how technological domestication is being shaped in a paradigm of consumer culture that is fused with the infrastructural and cultural logics of the Internet and social media. © The Author(s) 2020."

For the development of this study, a methodology based on personal interviews with the main managers of the series (director, scriptwriter, influencers and a Chef) has been followed. As a result, the new transmedia narratives represent a phenomenon of communication and identity construction of an audiovisual format. This has generated some far-reaching conclusions: It is about carrying out a hybrid cinematographic campaign based on a transmedia designed to unify digital tools (designed for Smartphone) and a physical route mapping the city of Seville, linking it to strategic sectors such as tourism and the gastronomy.

Secondary analysis in a randomized trial of a Facebook-delivered adolescent health campaign targeting mothers with posts on HPV vaccination was undertaken with the aims of (a) determining whether the pre–post-change occurred in self-reports of the mothers on HPV vaccination of their adolescent daughters; (b) describing the comments and reactions to vaccine posts; (c) exploring the relationship of campaign engagement of the mothers assessed by their comments and reactions to posts to change in the self-reports of the mothers of HPV vaccination. Materials and Methods: Mothers of daughters aged 14–17 were recruited from 34 states of the US (n = 869). A social media campaign was delivered in two Facebook private groups that differed in that 16% of posts in one were focused on indoor tanning (IT) and 16% in the other, on prescription drug misuse, assigned by randomization. In both groups, posts promoted HPV vaccination (n = 38 posts; no randomization) and vaccination for other disease (e.g., influenza, n = 49). HPV and other vaccination posts covered the need for a vaccine, the number of adolescents vaccinated, how vaccines are decreasing the infection rates, and stories of positive benefits of being vaccinated or harms from not vaccinating. Guided by social cognitive theory and diffusion of innovations theory, posts were intended to increase knowledge, perceived risk, response efficacy (i.e., a relative advantage over not vaccinated daughters), and norms for vaccination. Some vaccination posts linked to stories to capitalize on identification effects in narratives, as explained in transportation theory. All mothers received the posts on vaccination (i.e., there was no randomization). Mothers completed surveys at baseline and 12- and 18-month follow-up to assess HPV vaccine uptake by self-report measures. Reactions (such as sad, angry) and comments to each HPV-related post were counted and coded. Results: Initiation of HPV vaccination (1 dose) was reported by 63.4% of mothers at baseline, 71.3% at 12-month posttest (pre/post p < 0.001), and 73.3% at 18-month posttest (pre/post p < 0.001). Completion of HPV vaccination (two or three doses) was conveyed by 50.2% of mothers at baseline, 62.5% at 12-month posttest (pre/post p < 0.001), and 65.9% at 18-month posttest (pre/post p < 0.001). For posts on HPV vaccines, 8.1% of mothers reacted (n = 162 total), and 68.4% of posts received a reaction (63.2% like; 13.2% love, 7.9% sad). In addition, 7.6% of mothers commented (n = 122; 51 unfavorable, 68 favorable, 1 neutral), and 50.0% of these posts received a comment. There were no differences in pre–post change in vaccine status by the count of reactions or comments to HPV vaccine posts (Ps > 0.05). Baseline vaccination was associated with the valence of comments to HPV vaccine posts (7.2% of mothers whose daughters had completed the HPV series at baseline made a favorable comment but 7.6% of mothers whose daughters were unvaccinated made an unfavorable comment). Conclusion: Effective strategies are needed in social media to promote HPV vaccines and counter misinformation about and resistance to them. Mothers whose daughters complete the HPV vaccine course might be recruited as influencers on HPV vaccines, as they may be predisposed to talk favorably about the vaccine. Comments from mothers who have not been vaccinated should be monitored to ensure that they do not spread vaccine-critical misinformation. Study limitations included lack of randomization and control group, relatively small number of messages on HPV vaccines, long measurement intervals, inability to measure views of vaccination posts, reduced generalizability related to ethnicity and social media use, and use of self-reported vaccine status.

Receiving video updates on a constant basis may not only serve adolescents' informational or entertainment needs, but also fuel their fear of missing out (FoMO), which can lower their social well-being in the long term. Supportive communication with parents about digital media use might be an important resource in preventing these negative outcomes. This study used a national quota-based two-wave panel survey of early adolescents between 10 and 14 years (NT2 = 384) to investigate the influence of adolescents' perceived quality of communication with their parents on the relation between following vloggers, FoMO, and social well-being.

This phenomenon is amplified in online networks by particularly influential individuals: influencers. Although this concept originated in social media, recent research shows how influencers can also exist in games and affect players' long-term retention. Prolonged retention caused by influencers could benefit gameful systems, especially if the system's goal is positive behavioural change. Retention is desirable because it can aid in internalizing new habits. Therefore, we investigated retention influencers' presence within a location-based persuasive gamified system (Play&Go) and their influence on other behaviours (i.e., the pursuit of a gamification goal), via social network analysis techniques. Results show how retention influencers exist in Play&Go and how studying different influence types (which push the systems' goals) may lead to different influencer groups. Our findings emphasize the importance of social mechanics in location-based gamification and discuss the value of understanding a player community to improve game design. © 2021 ACM."

However, little is known regarding acute physiological and perceptual responses to these online protocols compared to HIIT protocols used within research. The aim was to investigate acute physiological, perceptual and motivational responses to two HIIT protocols popular on social media, and compare these to two evidence-based protocols. Methods Twenty-seven recreationally active (>1 exercise session /week) participants (Age: 22±3y, BMI: 24.3±2.4) completed a randomised cross-over study, whereby each participant completed four HIIT protocols, two already established in research (Ergo-60:60 (cycling 10x60s at 100%Wmaxwith 60s rest), BW-60:60 (body-weight exercises 10x60swith 60s rest)) and two promoted on social media (SM-20:10 (body-weight exercises 20x20swith 10s rest) and SM-40:20 (body-weight exercises 15x40s with 20s rest)). Blood lactate, heart rate (HR), feeling scale (FS), felt arousal scale (FSA), enjoyment and perceived competence were measured in response to each protocol. Results Significant differences were observed between BW-60:60 and SM-20:10 for the proportion of intervals meeting the ACSM high-intensity exercise criterion (>80% of HRmax) (BW-60:60 93±10%, SM-20:10 74±20%, P = 0.039) and change in lactate (BW-60:60 +7.8±3.7mmol/L, SM-20:10 +5.5±2.6mmol/L, P = 0.001). The percentage of time spent above the criterion HR was also significantly lower in SM-20:10 compared to all other protocols (Ergo-60:60 13.9±4.9min, BW-60:60 13.5±3.5min, SM-40:20 12.1±2.4min, SM-20:10 7.7±3.1, P<0.05). No differences were observed in lowest reported FS between protocols (P = 0.268), but FS decreased linearly throughout Ergo-60:60 and BW-60:60 (first vs. last interval P<0.05), but not in SM-20:10 or SM-40:20 (P>0.05). Enjoyment was higher upon completion of BW- 60:60 compared to Ergo-60:60 and SM-40:20 (P<0.05). Conclusions This study shows that HIIT protocols available on social media offer an interesting realworld alternative for promoting exercise participation. Future studies should continue to investigate these highly popular and practical HIIT protocols. © 2021 Hesketh et al.

Based on a systematic literature review, we propose a conceptual framework that answers the fol-lowing research question: How can businesses, amidst and after the COVID‐19 pandemic, adapt their social media marketing strategy to create positive brand equity? The conceptual framework describes four components as the basis for a potential social media marketing strategy. First, (1) businesses need to develop a clear perspective on their current social media marketing activities, and (2) evaluate current branding elements. Based on this, (3) the timeline of marketing activities must be postponed or adapted to the needs of consumers. Lastly, (4) businesses must adapt their messaging to show empathy and deliver relevant information. Within this process, governmental parties, financial institutions, influencers, and consumers are identified as stakeholders who influence and assist businesses in optimizing their social media marketing strategy. These findings are relevant for academics and businesses to further understand the long‐term effects of COVID‐19 on social media marketing. Additionally, they highlight that the roles of online channels and the consumer are expanding in the future. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Each individual has a chance to participate and influence any discussion. Even with all the freedom, people’s behavior falls under patterns that are observed in numerous situations. In this paper, we propose a methodology that defines and searches for common communication patterns in topical networks on Twitter. We analyze clusters according to four traits: number of nodes the cluster has, their degree and betweenness centrality values, number of node types, and whether the cluster is open or closed. We find that cluster structures can be defined as (a) fixed, meaning that they are repeated across datasets/topics following uniform rules, or (b) variable if they follow an underlying rule regardless of their size. This approach allows us to classify 90% of all conversation clusters, with the number varying by topic. An increase in cluster size often results in difficulties finding topological shape rules; however, these types of clusters tend to exhibit rules regarding their node relationships in the form of centralization. Most individuals do not enter large‐scale discussions on Twitter, meaning that the simplicity of communication clusters implies repetition. In general, power laws apply for the influencer connection distribution (degree centrality) even in topical networks. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee  MDPI,  Basel,  Switzerland."

Inappropriate health-seeking behaviours contribute to adverse outcomes, and community engagement is key in driving behavioural change. WHO has highlighted East Africa as a geographical area of concern for snakebite envenoming. The overall aim of the project is to develop a community engagement toolkit for snakebite envenoming and other NTDs. The objective of this scoping review was to identify current practices in recent community engagement in rural East Africa; the applicability of these results to snakebite envenoming are discussed. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched from 1 January 2017 to 3 September 2020. Search terms were used to identify publications which related to rural communities and health or disease, for both humans and animals. After reviewing the full papers for all geographical areas, 112 publications were included, 30 of which were conducted in East Africa. Papers included nine different countries and covered a broad range of health topics; notably, water, sanitation and hygiene, nutrition, and maternal and child health. Only one publication considered animal health. The most common form of engagement was in the context of a group meeting, lecture, presentation, discussion or question and answer session (63.3%). A variety of locations within the community were used to engage with people, the most common being an individual's household (23.3%). Communication factors was the key influencer for engagement, both positively and negatively. Key barriers to engagement include local languages and health beliefs, literacy levels, mobile phone ownership and the level of mobile Internet coverage, burden of agricultural work and weather conditions. This study provides an extensive overview of recent public health community engagement in East Africa, which will serve as a useful resource for any group seeking to plan an intervention in remote and rural areas in East Africa.

On the one hand, their network power is often tied to their social identity as creators of engaging material. On the other hand, their ability to promote commercial products and services steps outside the traditionally distinct commercial–social, occupational–personal divides. In this work, the network morphologies of influencers are explored in relation to their delivery of sponsored and non-sponsored content. This article explores how the disclosure of content as ‘sponsored’ affects audience reception. We show how that the promotion of content on social media often generates higher levels of engagement and receptiveness amongst their audience despite the platform’s assumption of organic non-commercial relationships. We find that engagement levels are highest among smaller out-degree networks. Additionally, we demonstrate that sponsored content not only returns a higher level of engagement, but that the effect of sponsorship is relatively consistent across out-degree network sizes. In sum, we suggest that social media audiences are not sensitive to commercial sponsorship when tied to identity, as long as that performance is convincing and consistent. © 2021 by the author.

However, those responsible for implementing influencer marketing campaigns are susceptible to the “myth of viewability” and rely on the Cost Per View (CPV) evaluation metric, rather than the more appropriate Cost Per Action (CPA). The current research explores the aforementioned myth from a hospitality management perspective by identifying the types of image (or photo) which attract more audience commentary or liking. A qualitative research approach is adopted involving two experiments with influencer pairs across the restaurant context in Taipei, Taiwan. We selected influencers Q and S as our manipulated group. In sharing images on their social media platform, it was found that they make greater use of personal than of food related images. The opposite was the case for the controlled group - influencers X and A – who shared more food than personal images. The researchers tracked viewer responses and then actions towards influencer postings to determine (a) which influencer approach draws more views and (b) the costs that are attributable to views and/or actions. They drew upon the findings to formulate an Owner-Influencer Matrix, a strategic planning tool and framework that helps owners and influencers to optimize influencer marketing. It is concluded that interactions between influencers and business owners should be beneficial to both parties. This empirical study may provide business owners and social media influencers with insights about communicating the respective brand values of their counterparts and designing sponsorship collaborations with a capacity to generate the desired consumer responses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Our findings show stark differences among the different genders. In relation to women, we found a salient discussion on the risks of domestic violence due to the lockdown especially towards women and girls, while emphasizing financial challenges. The public discourses around SGM mostly revolved around blood donation concerns, which is a reminder of the discrimination against some of these communities during the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Whether followers’ trust in the influencer leads to their loyalty to the influencer and desirable marketing outcomes (i.e., product attitude, purchase intention) was also examined. Results revealed that trust mediated the impacts of expertise, authenticity, and homophily on loyalty and marketing outcomes. However, physical attractiveness was not significant in building relational trust. Also, the moderating role of relationship strength was confirmed in authenticity-trust and trust-loyalty linkages.

How do impartiality claims about brand-focused social media posts influence persuasion knowledge, credibility, intentions to engage with the message, attitudes, and purchase intentions? This manuscript reports findings from 287 women students in the U.S. who participated in a within-subjects experiment. We observed that posts claiming non-sponsorship were perceived as less likely to be advertisements or have selling intention. These non-sponsorship claims also enhanced trustworthiness. Honesty claims enhanced expertise. Honesty and non-sponsorship worked together to boost trustworthiness, expertise, attitudes, and purchase intentions, yet messages with no claims at all yielded the most positive attitudes and intentions. This illustrates that impartiality claims work better together than in isolation. Impartiality claims performed similarly for influencers and celebrities.

Organizations and their agencies have to adapt existing or even develop new management routines for planning, organizing, and controlling their influencer activities. This article provides a systematic overview on their emerging routines and rationales. On the basis of 20 explorative expert interviews with organization and agency representatives, we found that organizations deploy strategic influencer communication mainly for pursuing marketing objectives, while the potential for achieving Public Relations objectives is not fully exploited. In organizing influencer campaigns, organizations and their agencies have to balance the organization's control expectations and the social media influencer's demand for creative freedom. But despite the considerable investment that organizations make in strategic influencer communication, the controlling of influencer activities is only slowly coming out of its infancy. We conclude that strategic communication professionals are still learning how to best manage their influencer activities. From a conceptual perspective, we argue that strategic communication outsources traditional Public Relations functions to influencers. These outsourcing processes carry implications for theory and conceptual development in strategic communication research. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

These networks are vital for expanding scope and impact. People in these networks influence each other. Social influencers spread the knowledge in the network. Identification of such influencers is a challenging task. Generally, in past studies varied qualitative metrics like centrality, connectivity etc has been popularly used for identifying the influencers. In a network it has been noticed that every person interacts in the network in context to its own interest areas. He influences specific to his interest domains. Based on this belief, the aim of this paper is to detect topic-wise influencers in social media so that we can target person or influencer appropriately for influence maximisation. This paper focuses on measuring the strength of topic-level social influence using sentiments of the text used for interaction by social network user and later fuzzy modeling has been applied. Fuzzy modeling help in finding the person probability index of influence (positive or negative) in context to a different topics he is contributing in social media. In addition, three user features- engagement Index, activity index and connectivity Index has been utilized to compute the user overall influencer score. For experimentation, the tweets from the Twitter have been used to evaluate the proposed method. © 2021 ACM."

Although influencers are urged to comply with the regulations governing sponsorship disclosure, a considerable number of influencers fail to disclose sponsorship properly in paid advertisements. In this paper, we propose a learning-to-rank based model, Sponsored Post Detector (SPoD), to detect undisclosed sponsorship of social media posts by learning various aspects of the posts such as text, image, and the social relationship among influencers and brands. More precisely, we exploit image objects and contextualized information to obtain the representations of the posts and also utilize Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a network which consists of influencers, brands, and posts with embed social media attributes. We further optimize the model by conducting manifold regularization based on temporal information and mentioned brands in posts. The extensive studies and experiments are conducted on sampled real-world Instagram datasets containing 1,601,074 posts, which mention 26,910 brands, published over 6 years by 38,113 influencers.

With a particular focus on WeChat public accounts, this investigation responds to two critical research questions: first, what differentiates official party-state social media presences from semi-official presences, and second, what unique role do semi-official WeChat accounts play in the contemporary Chinese propaganda apparatus? This article samples content published by five dyads of official and semi-official WeChat public accounts during the first fifteen days of June 2019. The results of this comparative, case-study-based discourse analysis support two conclusions. First, semi-official WeChat accounts posture as independent from the party-state in order to attract large followings and gain credibility. Second, semi-official WeChat public accounts operate as “astroturfed influencers,” enabling the Chinese propaganda apparatus to covertly manipulate online discourse with extraordinary efficiency. © The Author(s) 2021."

In order to convey the message about the value of their brands to their target market, organizations hire influential people who are considered to be the creators of public opinion in a virtual environ-ment. Nowadays, social media are crowded with micro and macro influencers, or at least those who present themselves as such. Their main job is to represent and recommend brands to other users (their followers) and thus influence con-sumer attitudes about brands and possibly strengthen their purchasing decisions. Very of-ten, influencers on social media are hired by companies to promote their brands for a fee. In order to have more control over their communi-cation activities, companies provide them, in ad-vance, with the content they want to be conveyed to consumers, but also the time frame when the message should be launched. In this way, organ-izations try to reduce the risk of turning elec-tronic word-of-mouth (EWOM) communication into a negative one. In order for consumers to trust the recommendations of influencers on social media, these people need to have signifi-cant expertise in a certain area, charisma and re-spect from other users, so that their credibility af-fects the value of content and recommendations they place in the online environment.

Misleading information from nonexperts is potentially harmful. OBJECTIVE: To identify the top influencers posting about nonsurgical cosmetic procedures on Instagram, verify their credentials, and analyze their content to empower dermatologists to effectively join the online conversation, combat harmful misinformation, and preserve the expertise and influence of board-certified dermatologists. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using the Klear marketing platform, Instagram influencers with more than 50,000 followers were identified. Influence rating, top posts, and other metrics were extracted using proprietary algorithms. RESULTS: Ninety nine influencers were identified. Of the top 10, 70% were board-certified plastic surgeons. Physicians not board-certified in a core cosmetic specialty had the highest influencer rating and number of followers. The most popular posts were of before and after photographs and personal posts. CONCLUSION: Dermatologists may be able to increase their Instagram footprint by posting frequently, especially of before and after and personal photographs, using hashtags, Instagram live and Instagram television, and Instagram stories. It is important for the dermatology community to find a way to ethically navigate social media to have a seat at the table and meet patients where they are.

We investigate how Instagram influencers impact consumer parasocial interaction (PSI) in the relationship between value perception and purchase intention. Whereas customers influence the attractiveness (social and physical) PSI of social media influencers, studies of the effects of luxury purchasing PSI in Thailand are limited. We examine the relationship between PSI and followers of luxury fashion’s value (social, personal, and conspicuous) on social media. We use structural equation modeling to evaluate hypotheses by conducting an online survey with 400 Thai millennial respondents who had experience following influencers on Instagram. The findings indicate that Thai millennials accept Instagram influencers’ PSIs in terms of value perception and motivation to purchase luxury fashion. The attractiveness of influencers initiates the formation of PSI; followers receive value perception and react to purchasing intention from influencers. The concepts were investigated to prove that influencers’ power can encourage followers to mitigate negative consequences by delivering value perceptions on PSI.

It utilises digital tools to compile a corpus of Instagram posts that foreground corporeal hybridity, and examines this social media data through the lenses of feminist STS, affect theory and digital studies. This strategy offers a new vantage on the cyborg by connecting it to concrete and ongoing user practices. To make these interventions, this project focuses specifically on a genre of post popularised by Instagram fitness (or fitstagram) influencers – diptych photographic montages that oppose imperfectly ‘real’ material bodies to unrealistically ‘perfect’ media bodies. Although they formally rely on binary logics (real v. perfect, offline v. online), the posts simultaneously deconstruct them in a number of ways. These repeated boundary transgressions reflect users’ lived experiences of hybrid online/offline corporeality and help forward a theory of cyborg embodiment that relies on quotidian practices as opposed to fixed products or identities.

Many practical problems, however, involve aspects of both. For example, brand X may seek to hire an influencer Y to create sponsored content to be posted on social media platform Z. This problem has a hidden action component (the brand may not be able or willing to observe the amount of effort exerted by the influencer), but also a private type component (influencers may have different costs per unit-of-effort). This effort and cost per unit-of-effort perspective naturally leads to a principal-agent problem with hidden action and single-dimensional private type, which generalizes both the classic principal-agent hidden action model of contract theory a la Grossmann and Hart [1986] and the (procurement version) of single-dimensional mechanism design a la Myerson [1983]. A natural goal in this model is to design an incentive-compatible contract, which consist of an allocation rule that maps types to actions, and a payment rule that maps types to payments for the stochastic outcomes of the chosen action. Our main contribution is an LP-duality based characterization of implementable allocation rules for this model, which applies to both discrete and continuous types. This characterization shares important features of Myerson's celebrated characterization result, but also departs from it in significant ways. We present several applications, including a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal contract with a constant number of actions. This in sharp contrast to recent work on hidden action problems with multi-dimensional private information, which has shown that the problem of computing an optimal contract for constant numbers of actions is APX-hard. © 2021 ACM."

However, Bilibili users often express their negative attitude towards product placement in videos of content creators, which may cause number of followers to drop for content creators and lead expected marketing effect to be unattainable for brand marketers. Therefore, the main purpose of the study is to investigate the reasons why users of Bilibili have negative attitudes towards the product placement in videos by content creators and propose three potential factors - content authenticity, content congruity and product involvement, which can influence Bilibili users' negative attitude towards product placement. After sending questionnaires to Bilibili users and doing data analysis, the study gets the results that content authenticity, content congruity and product placement are all negatively correlated with Bilibili users' negative attitude towards product placement, and product involvement is positively correlated with content authenticity and content congruity.

This study investigates social network structures among Twitter users with regard to the Covid-19 outbreak at its onset and its spread. The data were derived from two Twitter datasets by using a search query, “coronavirus,” on February 28th, 2020, when the coronavirus outbreak was at a relatively early stage. The first dataset is a collection of tweets used in investigating social network structures and for visualization. The second dataset comprises tweets that have citations of scientific research publications regarding coronavirus. The collected data were analyzed to examine numerical indicators of the social network structures, subgroups, influencers, and features regarding research citations. This was also essential to measure the statistical relationships among social elements and research citations. The findings revealed that individuals tend to have conversations with specific people in clusters regarding daily issues on coronavirus without prominent or central voice tweeters. Tweets related to coronavirus were often associated with entertainment, politics, North Korea, and business. During their conversations, the users also responded to and mentioned the U.S. president, the World Health Organization (WHO), celebrities, and news channels. Meanwhile, people shared research articles about the outbreak, including its spread, symptoms related to the disease, and prevention strategies.

Employing techniques borrowed from data journalism, it develops a form of cross-platform analysis that is attuned to both commensurability as well as platform specificity. It analyses the most engaged-with or top-ranked political content on seven online platforms: TikTok, 4chan, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Google Web Search. Discussing the extent to which social media platforms marginalize mainstream media and mainstream the fringe, the analyses found that TikTok parodies mainstream media, 4chan and Reddit dismiss it and direct users to alternative influencer networks and extreme YouTube content. Twitter prefers the hyperpartisan over it. Facebook’s “fake news” problem also concerns declining amounts of mainstream media referenced. Instagram has influencers (rather than, say, experts) dominating user engagement. By comparison, Google Web Search buoys the liberal mainstream (and sinks conservative sites), but generally gives special interest sources, as they were termed in the study, the privilege to provide information rather than official sources. The piece concludes with a discussion of source and “platform criticism”, concerning how online platforms are seeking to filter the content that is posted or found there through increasing editorial intervention. These “editorial epistemologies”, applied especially around COVID-19 keywords, are part of an expansion of so-called content moderation to what I call “serious queries”, or keywords that return official information. Other epistemological strategies for editorially moderating the misinformation problem are also treated. © Copyright © 2021 Rogers."

The burden of psoriasis impacts both the physiological and psychological areas of one’s life. Given the robust use of the internet and social media, patients have turned to Instagram for educational and social support to discuss psoriasis. Objective: This study aimed to characterize how patients interact with Instagram to cope with the biopsychosocial aspects of psoriasis. We analyzed journals and organizations, and compared them with the public profiles of individuals diagnosed with psoriasis who provided information and refuge. Our goal was to identify how followers engaged and what type of content they were most receptive to in terms of psoriasis. Methods: All journals and organizations representing psoriasis were selected for review. The top 10 public profiles of individuals diagnosed with psoriasis were also selected for comparison. The numbers of followers, followings, and posts were noted to evaluate popularity. The numbers of likes and comments were also recorded to understand engagement. Results: On comparing journals and organizations to public profiles, we found that the former had a greater number of followers but engaged less with the audience on Instagram based on the number of profiles they followed. Profiles of individuals with psoriasis produced content that was more personal and relatable, including experiences with flares, motivational text, and emotional support. The content produced by journals and organizations was geared toward education and providing peer-reviewed resources and commentary from licensed health care professionals. Followers were more engaged via “likes” than “comments” on the Instagram profiles of journals and organizations, as well as the public profiles of individuals diagnosed with psoriasis. Conclusions: There was evident online presence of journals and organizations, and public profiles of individuals providing content regarding psoriasis on Instagram. However, there were distinguishing features for the type of content being produced. Journals and organizations took the traditional approach in providing evidence-based information, whereas the public profiles of individuals provided content related to the psychosocial needs of the psoriasis community. The 10 profiles of individuals provided posts involving creativity and real experiences, which were evidently well-received based on “likes” and “comments.” This research helps us appreciate what the audience on Instagram is looking for to further address how we can merge these needs to provide a holistic platform on Instagram for both providers and patients. Social media creates a space for collaboration, which can be advantageous for journals and organizations to work with patient volunteers from diverse backgrounds who can help build a therapeutic alliance and public presence on Instagram with their viewers in order to deliver medical peer-reviewed information. ©Sarin H Pakhdikian, Benjamin K P Woo."

Images have recently been the focus of studies on social movements, highlighting the importance of visual activism in social media. However, the relationship between these visual narratives and mythological structures and how they operate to mobilize social change has not been significantly explored. This study analyses the role of environmental activism memes on social media and how, in anthropological terms, they can be understood as myths or narratives that offer a model for perceiving, understanding, judging and acting in the world. We draw from ongoing research into eco-influencers on Instagram, taking environmental memes characterized by binary oppositions of “before” and “after” as the study subject. This contrast establishes a temporal narrative and future prediction, involving a cause-and-effect relationship and a moral judgement of our actions. We argue that, in the case of the environmental meme, the myth-based approach helps in understanding its role in articulating the cosmic, social and personal orders as it brings human action into harmony with the cosmic order while projecting its images onto the human experience. © 2021"

In this study, we examined the concept of stakeholder engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and identified how organizations engage stakeholders in their CSR communication by analyzing successful CSR programs. Two coders conducted a content analysis of 146 Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) Silver Anvil Award-winning CSR campaigns implemented during the past ten years. The results show that many organizations have engaged stakeholders in their CSR programs in various ways to increase awareness about social issues, change stakeholder behavior, and create favorable attitudes toward the organizations. As for CSR communication strategies, stakeholder response strategies were frequently observed, which is relevant to the two-way asymmetric communication model. Many organizations receive feedback from their stakeholders and demonstrate how they integrate their stakeholders’ concerns. The result also shows that social media is widely used for digital engagement. However, despite its potential to become an interactive, dialogic space, response strategy is used more often than involvement strategy. Although co-creating a CSR strategy with stakeholders and making a shared decision (i.e., stakeholder involvement strategy) is ideal for building a mutually beneficial relationship between an organization and its stakeholders, few organizations have employed this strategy. This study also found that partnership is a common stakeholder engagement strategy in CSR communication. Many organizations have used third-party endorsement and engaged nonprofits, opinion leaders, and social media influencers in their CSR communication. Copyright © 2021 by the author(s).

Celebrities sometimes intentionally create misleading posts in OSNs to guide people for commercial or marketing purposes. The intentional phrases from such posts can affect the online rating and even lead to a frenzy shopping. That's part of the reasons that the top social media influencers are targeted by merchants to help promote products. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that all sponsored posts must be clearly disclosed. However, many influencers do not follow the FTC rules. As a result, people may be misled by the undisclosed sponsorship. In this study, for the first time, we explore the credibility of posts on Instagram and analyze if an influencer complies with the FTC requirements. We build an effective Undisclosed Sponsored Post Detection (USPD) framework based on an ensemble of machine learning classifiers. The USPD framework consists of three main processes: (i) feature extraction, (ii) model construction and (iii) credibility and integrity analysis. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a high accuracy of 83% for undisclosed sponsored post detection. The proposed framework also takes advantages of the text, user and image features in OSN posts to effectively analyze how much an influencer can be trusted. © 2021 IEEE."

While YouTube and other social media continue to reproduce the post-feminist sensibility, recent studies indicate that it also embraces manifestations of popular feminism. This research focuses on two popular female Spanish YouTubers, Dulceida and Yellow Mellow, and its aim is to analyse how they build and represent their gender identity. Particular emphasis is put on the negotiation and/or integration of feminist precepts into those identities, in order to determine whether they contribute to the creation of new gender imaginaries. A qualitative methodology, which includes four models of analysis, is used to cover the representations from the audio-visual, socio-semiotic and textual aspects.

In order to explore COVID-19-related implications on drug trends/behaviour and on most popular psychotropic substances debated, the focus here was on the constantly updated, very popular, Reddit social platform’s posts and comments. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of r/Drugs and related subreddits, using a social media listening netnographic approach, was carried out. The post/comments analysed covered the time-frame December 2019–May 2020. Between December 2019 and May 2020, the number of whole r/Drugs subreddit members increased from 619,563 to 676,581 members, respectively, thus increasing by 9.2% by the end of the data collection. Both the top-level r/Drugs subreddit and 92 related subreddits were quantitatively analysed, with posts/comments related to 12 drug categories. The drugs most frequently commented on included cannabinoids, psychedelics, opiates/opioids, alcohol, stimulants and prescribed medications. The qualitative analysis was carried out focussing on four subreddits, relating to some 1685 posts and 3263 comments. Four main themes of discussion (e.g., lockdown-associated immunity and drug intake issues; drug-related behaviour/after-quarantine plans’ issues; lockdown-related psychopathological issues; and peer-topeer advice at the time of COVID-19) and four categories of Redditors (e.g., those continuing the use of drugs despite the pandemic; the “couch epidemiologists”; the conspirationists/pseudo-science influencers; and the recovery-focused users) were tentatively identified here. A mixed-methods, social network-based analysis provided a range of valuable information on Redditors’ drug use/behaviour during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Previous research has explored sources of information and influence on youth vaping, including marketing, ads, family, peers, social media, and the internet. This research endeavors to expand understanding of peer influence. Our hypothesis is that friends’ influence on teen vapers’ first electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use varies by demographic variables and awareness of ENDS advertising. In August–October 2017, youth (n = 3174) aged 13–18 completed an online survey to quantify ENDS behaviors and attitudes and were invited to participate in follow-up online research in November-December 2017 to probe qualitative context around perceptions and motivations (n = 76). This analysis focused on the ENDS users, defined as having ever tried any ENDS product, from the survey (n = 1549) and the follow-up research (n = 39). Among survey respondents, friends were the most common source of vapers’ first ENDS product (60%). Most survey respondents tried their first ENDS product while “hanging out with friends” (54%). Among follow-up research participants, the theme of socializing was also prominent. ENDS advertising and marketing through social media had a strong association with friend networks; in fact, the odds of friends as source of the first vaping experience were 2 times higher for those who had seen ENDS ads on social media compared with other types of media. The influence of friends is particularly evident among non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics/Latinos, those living in urban areas, those living in high-income households, those with higher self-esteem, and those who experiment with vaping. These findings support the premise that peer influence is a primary social influencer and reinforcer for vaping. Being included in a popular activity appears to be a strong driving force. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In contrast, comparatively few studies exists on the role of online activists, defined informally as users who actively participate in socially-minded online campaigns. Automatically discovering activists who can potentially be approached by organisations that promote social campaigns is important, but not easy, as they are typically active only locally, and, unlike influencers, they are not central to large social media networks. We make the hypothesis that such interesting users can be found on Twitter within temporally and spatially localised contexts. We define these as small but topical fragments of the network, containing interactions about social events or campaigns with a significant online footprint. To explore this hypothesis, we have designed an iterative discovery pipeline consisting of two alternating phases of user discovery and context discovery. Multiple iterations of the pipeline result in a growing dataset of user profiles for activists, as well as growing set of online social contexts. This mode of exploration differs significantly from prior techniques that focus on influencers, and presents unique challenges because of the weak online signal available to detect activists. The paper describes the design and implementation of the pipeline as a customisable software framework, where user-defined operational definitions of online activism can be explored.

Previous research has mainly focused on influencer marketing as a commercial action designed to enhance followers' perceptions and reactions toward promoted brands, ignoring the consequences of these promotional actions on influencers' credibility and their relationships with their followers. This research sheds light on the topic by exploring how influencers' promotional actions affect their credibility, and followers' attitudes and behavioral responses toward the influencer (i.e., to continue following, imitate, and recommend them to other users). A study addressed to the followers of a popular influencer was carried out to test the research model. The results showed that perceived influencer-product congruence positively affects followers' perceptions of the credibility of, and attitude toward, influencers, and negatively affects perceptions of paid communication. Followers' perceptions that influencers have been paid to take part in promotional activities harms their credibility; however, credibility is essential for generating positive attitudes toward the influencer. Finally, both perceived credibility and attitude foster positive behavioral responses toward the influencer; influencers must enhance these factors to retain their influencing capacity. This research provides managerial implications for influencers and brands that can help enhance followers’ experiences when exposed to promotions on social media. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Despite the mounting interest of researchers and practitioners, the resulting scholarly work remains divergent, partial and fragmented. In light of the pivotal role of SMIs on the consumer decision journey and as this research domain is still developing, a comprehensive and critical overview of extant research on this topic is sorely needed. In response, this paper is the first to consolidate the present state of research on IM within social media settings. More specifically, a systematic review of relevant studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals across diverse fields was conducted in order to identify key themes and dominant concepts. The analysis of 68 articles from 29 Chartered Association of Business Schools-ranked journals forges a robust understanding of this phenomenon, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the appeal of SMIs and their influential power in shaping consumer attitudes and behaviour. Based on the analysis, an integrative multidimensional framework is presented that considers antecedents, mediators and moderators of potential outcomes, as well as contextual factors that translate into consumer behaviour. In so doing, various research gaps are identified and avenues for future research are proposed that reflect important emerging areas and unexplored realms with reference to theory, context and methodology. Conclusively, implications of this study for theory and practice are discussed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Methods: Indigenous people (17-24 years) participated in face-to-face interviews or online Facebook conversations. Discussions were informed by the Integrated Model of Behaviour Change exploring perceptions of self, health and wellbeing, social media use, decision making around health and environmental influences on their health. Interviews and online conversations were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Eighteen young Indigenous Australians participated. Three themes were identified (a) Family and community connection in constructing health beliefs; (b) Individual health-seeking behaviours, mental health status and the importance of physical activity; and (c) peers and others were key influencers of health behaviour on social media. Conclusions: Social connection and social media may provide platforms for young Indigenous people to facilitate exchange of culturally relevant information and encourage behaviour change alongside family, peer and community support. So what?: Unless accompanied with environmental changes, young adults may struggle to assert their individual agency and realise healthful behaviours, therefore strategies to change the environment are urgently required. © 2020 Australian Health Promotion Association"

Relationships between publics and organizations continue to be first and foremost, but the process and possibilities for mutually beneficial relationships are being rewritten in situ. This volume aims to explore and understand highly engaged publics in a variety of social media contexts and across networks. The hope is the expansion and extension of public relations theories and models in this book helps move the discipline forward to keep up with the practice and the media environment. Contributors analyzed a range of organizations and industries, including corporate, entertainment, government, and political movements, to consider how public relations practitioners can facilitate ethical and effective communication between parties. A consistent thread was the need for organizations and practitioners to better understand the diverse backgrounds of publics, including age, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, beyond surface-level demographic stereotypes and assumptions. This book will be of interest to researchers, academics, and students in the field of public relations and communication, especially those with a particular interest in online engagement and social media as a PR tool. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Amber L.

Some providers develop globally popular profiles, becoming ""influencers"" in their field. OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize posts found on top profiles by type and determine the degree of patient interaction within each type. METHODS: A social media tracking tool (Awario, Belarus) compiled a list of the top 33 facial plastic surgery Instagram profiles based on number of followers and ""reach,"" obtained on September 22, 2019. Profiles not belonging to American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ABFPRS)-certified surgeons were excluded, leading to 20 profiles. The most recent 18 posts at the time of data extraction were categorized into: (1) clinical or professional, (2) lifestyle, and (3) patients. The average number of ""likes,"" as a percentage of total followers, was calculated for each category for each profile. Data were gathered from September to November 2019. RESULTS: Most top profiles belong to ABFPRS-certified surgeons and were not verified. Clinical pictures and patient posts were 42.78% and 41.94% of those sampled, respectively. Lifestyle content was 19.05%. Followers interacted with clinical posts the most, having an average of 6.79% of follower interaction. Patient and lifestyle posts had 2.88% and 3.81%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Instagram is an important communication tool for facial plastic surgeons to engage in promotion and education. It is important to understand what trends tend to attract followers and engagement. Our study showed that more clinical content, separate from patient pictures, tended to be popular with both providers and followers. © 2020 The Aesthetic Society.

Can the right hashtag and filter create meaningful policy reforms? Will digital activism replace in-person protesting? What happens when the line between activist and influencer blur? While Twitter and Facebook receive the bulk of attention when it comes to social media influencing politics, Instagram is increasingly a site where users and organizations craft messaging and display their demands. From highly stylized selfies to tongue in cheek memes, politics are abundant on Instagram despite the platform's reputation for frivolity, decadence, and beauty. This chapter explores how social movement actors utilize Instagram to deliver complex political messages in beautiful and often humorous packages. Using data from Instagram projects, I provide an overview of how some organizations have embraced the platform and what that can tell us about digital political performances in general and the significance of Instagram specifically. My data consist of posts from Women's March official account, public posts using the hashtag ""womensmarch,"" and posts from six reproductive justice organizations. I utilize mixed methods with exploratory and targeted content analyses, and an original 1,200 post quantitative dataset. I examine how social movement organizations perform politics and how those performances develop over time due to political changes or audience engagement. Conventional understandings of the platform might suggest that posts prioritize likes, positive or upbeat messaging, and visual aesthetics; however, I find that while some organizations adhere to convention, others prioritize their messaging over popularity. This paper first dives into the many methodological challenges and opportunities Instagram offers, then details two distinct but related cases of progressive movements, and finally ends with a discussion of the importance of understanding the political possibilities and dangers of the influence of social media on our political realities. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Thus, the analysis of people's opinions and habits is essential for many companies' modernization and survival. On social networks, people generally share their views and visit other people's opinions about products, news, and trends, and the concept of ""influential person""emerges. An influential person (or social media influencer) today is considered a marketing strategy. The Brazilian dairy industry has been standing out every year, and one of the promising areas is cheese production. The 2019 annual report1 by ABLV (Associação Brasileira da Indústria de Lácteos Longa Vida) indicates that there was an increase of 32% in liters of milk destined for cheese production in Brazil compared to 2009, which is greater than the percentage growth of milk UHT (26%). Intending to collect information from social networks to find influential people, who appreciate artisanal cheeses, and who can influence potential new consumers, this work presents REDIC, a proposal for analysis, recommendation, and content propagation network, considering the Brazilian artisanal cheese market. REDIC classifies the user's content and interactions using ontologies and complex networks, deriving new relationships and allowing interconnecting information on different social networks. REDIC was developed to support the market research of artisanal cheeses in a renowned Brazilian agribusiness institution. The results obtained through feasibility studies showed that the solution allows the search for communities of digital influencers who talk about artisanal cheeses and the dissemination of information on the network. © 2021 ACM."

Some entities were closed, but the biggest market players were able to concentrate their efforts on interacting with visitors through social networks, public attention, frequent press mentions and discussions of influencers as synergies of communication policy tools. The purpose of the paper is to make proposals for improving the communication policy of cinema chains under new challenges. Based on a system analysis and indices of activity in social media of ten key Ukrainian cinema chains during the COVID-19 period, the main trends of their behavior and vision of development were determined. Changes were detected in the product strategy. To increase the effectiveness of communication policy, a focus should be on enhanced communications with consumers, especially through the implementation of a content-plan for publications on Facebook and Instagram, including facts from the lives of actors or filmmaking process, uniting followers around the filming theme, interacting, etc. Based on the above, the proposals are made to strengthen communication policy: activating posting frequency, generating more interesting content, and focusing on engaging with the followers. It turned out that such changes affect the key quality efficiency of social media marketing in two cinema chains. Such events rebuild the online community of moviegoers, which fosters loyalty and increases in visitors in the post-pandemic period. In this context, the implementation of online cinema in cooperation with distributors will contribute to formatting an online platform aimed at attracting a larger number of consumers, regardless of external circumstances. © Svitlana Melnychenko, Anatolii Mazaraki, Nadiya Vedmid, Alla Okhrimenko, Alona Shtanova, 2021."

Empirical evidence about which communication strategies are effective around breastfeeding messaging is scarce. To fill this gap, we aimed to identify influencers in the largest available Twitter database using social network analysis (n = 10,694 users), inductively analyze tweets, and explore communication strategies, motivations, and challenges via semi-structured interviews. Influencers had diverse backgrounds within and beyond the scientific health community (SHC; 42.7%): 54.7% were from the general public and 3% were companies. SHC contributed to most of the tweets (n = 798 tweets), disseminating guidelines and research findings more frequently than others (p < 0.001). Influencers from the general community mostly tweeted opinions regarding the current state of breastfeeding research and advocacy. Interviewees provided practical strategies (e.g., preferred visuals, tone, and writing style) to achieve personal and societal goals including career opportunities, community support, and improved breastfeeding practices. Complex challenges that need to be addressed were identified. Ideological differences regarding infant feeding may be hampering constructive communication, including differences in influencers’ interpretation of the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and in perspectives regarding which social media interactions encompass conflict of interest. © 2021 by the authors.

When the world pivoted to social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Army easily adapted to the new environment. The US Army Recruiting Command, responsible for marketing the Army and processing new recruit packets, focused on leveraging virtual tools, social media intelligence analysis, and adapting its traditional culture of in-person recruiting to a more online, story-centric and visual content recruiting effort. The COVID environment expedited the expansion of virtual recruiting practices from just marketing to include most of the job application process, traditionally completed in-person. The result is an engaged online following that is reaching the target audience who are eligible for military service. The Army achieved its personnel end-strength goal for fiscal year 2020 despite closing 1,400 physical recruiting stations for two weeks, reopening less than 1 per cent through the summer and cancelling nearly all physical recruiting events. The Army also demonstrated its adaptation to virtual recruiting by digitally processing eligible civilians into the military while taking care of its existing force by adhering to nationwide social distancing mandates. © 2021, Henry Stewart Publications.

The attendant YouTuber Chris R shared a video of the incident and thus provoked a discussion about racism in metal that also included widely discussed statements of Robb Flynn and Scott Ian, who both labelled Anselmo’s actions as racist. This is one of many examples that demonstrate changing information flows and increasingly fastpaced communication processes on social media platforms, including metal communities. Online platforms such as YouTube or Facebook not only enable musicians and bands to share videos, songs, tour dates or band gossip, but also to directly engage in discussions with their fans, which may also involve social and political issues. To provide an illustration of metal bands’ possibilities for online interaction, I have created a digital metal landscape that includes a set of digital tools, platforms and applications for different music-and non-music-related activities. Against this background, I discuss here contemporary metal musicians’ political and social engagement on social media and the reach of their comments within metal communities. Based on an analysis of Robb Flynn’s online presence in his The General Journals: Diary of a Frontman and Varg Vikernes’ Thulean Perspective, I will show that in the digital age, it is possible for metal musicians to become important influencers not only regarding music but also regarding social and political issues. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article."

At the time, this constituted the largest influencer- driven health campaign focused on these communities in the United States. Comments on posts were qualitatively coded to determine content perceptions among those exposed to posts. Digital metrics were also analyzed. During Year 1, posts reached 9 million social media users and generated 64 612 likes or shares, and 1512 responses. In Year 2, posts reached 8 million users and generated 155 600 likes or shares, and 3122 responses. Around 94%of public responses to posts were positive, suggesting this is a promising strategy to communicate health information and could shift social norms, particularly for heavily debated topics such as vaccination.

A hybrid model is designed to investigate users’ acceptance of YouTube and TikTok as social media platforms. The model focuses on four main external factors: Content richness, innovativeness, satisfaction, and enjoyment. These factors are connected with two TAM constructs which are perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The results have shown that both YouTube and TikTok are affected by PEOU, PU, personal innovativeness, flow theory, and content richness. Both social media networks provide up-to-date sources described as useful, enjoyable, and relevant. Nevertheless, the comparative results have shown that YouTube has deeply influenced users’ medical perception and knowledge compared to TikTok. It is created for the very mere purpose of socialization and self-expression.

The qualitative analysis of the comments was performed following the theoretical framework provided by the KM and NWKM. Collected data showed followers’ satisfaction, commitment, and relevance of the presented content, fulfilling the Level 1 of NWKM. Level 2 of NWKM was represented by 4 out of 5 dimensions (knowledge, attitude, confidence, commitment). No comments were found only for skills.

A final sample size of 1225 adolescents (aged 10 to 19 years) from the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Brazil, and Australia were included in controlled and qualitative studies. Instagram and Facebook were among the most popular social media platforms that influenced healthful eating behaviors (ie, fruit and vegetable intake) as well as unhealthful eating behaviors related to fast food advertising. Online forums served as accessible channels for eating disorder relapse prevention among youth. Social media influence converged around four central themes: (1) visual appeal, (2) content dissemination, (3) socialized digital connections, and (4) adolescent marketer influencers. Conclusions: Adolescent peer influence in social media environments spans the spectrum of healthy eating (ie, pathological) to eating disorders (ie, nonpathological). Strategic network-driven approaches should be considered for engaging adolescents in the promotion of positive dietary behaviors. ©Alicia Chung, Dorice Vieira, Tiffany Donley, Nicholas Tan, Girardin Jean-Louis, Kathleen Kiely Gouley, Azizi Seixas."

This study finds out how the 23 anglophone Sub-Saharan African countries' national health ministries and infectious disease agencies disseminated COVID-19 related information through their social media accounts within the first three months after the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 related qualitative and quantitative data types were collected from the social media accounts of the surveyed national health ministries and agencies for analysis. Over 86% of the African countries had presence on social media; Facebook was the most popular, though Twitter contained more posts. One of the credibility issues that was noticed is that most of the health ministries' and agencies' social media accounts were unverified and access to the social media accounts was not provided on most of their official websites. Information dissemination became more deliberate and increased significantly after the announcement of the fist cases of COVID-19 in the countries under review. Awareness creation, updates and news constituted the major categories of information that were disseminated, mostly in the form of derivative social media information before the announcement of the first COVID-19 case in the surveyed African countries. Campaigns against misinformation were barely undertaken by most of the countries. Strategies used by some countries included the employment of social media influencers and creation of content in local languages. Strategies that include development of health information content that targets different groups in African societies and the inclusion of elderly in the community and religious leaders as non-state actors in health information communication were recommended. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021."

In doing so, an algorithm falling into the category of dictionary-based approaches to study emotions contained in written text was developed and applied. Not only are the overall polarity and the single emotions contained in Instagram posts within Vienna investigated, but also the top 54 Viennese Instagram locations. A particular novelty of this study is the measurement of longitudinal developments from emotive text and the fine-grained analysis of single emotions in addition to the overall polarity. One crucial empirical result of the study is that more experience and self-confidence in Instagram posting, as well as increasing expectations, seem to result in becoming a more critical poster over time.

Although research on MSV and social media is growing, examinations of possible interventions like those employing social media in this population are scant. Given the growing interest in targeting MSV, the present systematic review was conducted. The PRISMA framework was used to conduct a systematic review of MSV and social media (N = 71). Queries were limited to articles published between 2010 and 2020. SAGE Journals, PubMed, and JSTOR were utilized. Terms and potential combinations were entered into the databases in varying Boolean combinations. Additional recorders were identified for inclusion via the reference sections of relevant records. After removing duplicates from the query results, we selected records of suspected relevance by title and screened abstracts. Finally, articles with relevant abstracts were reviewed thoroughly to determine whether they met inclusion criteria for the review. The employments of military leaders in a social media intervention puts into practice the military’s central values and development of its leadership core. This intervention promotes group solidarity while maximizing conversations around meaningful messages.

Materials and Methods: Data were collected through an online survey targeting three dog-owner participant groups. These consisted of individuals residing in: (1) Canada, (2) USA and (3) any country recruited through an educational social media site. USA and Canadian participants were financially compensated. Conjoint analysis was used to quantify the influence of antimicrobial cost, method of administration and drug importance in human medicine. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used for data evaluation. Results: A total of 809 surveys were completed. Antimicrobial cost accounted for 47% of dog-owner preferences, followed by method of administration (31%) and drug importance in human medicine (22%). All groups preferred lower cost drugs that were administered once by injection. Participants were more likely to prefer drugs considered “very important” in human medicine, except for the social media participants, who preferred drugs that were “not at all important.” Most respondents (86%) reported antimicrobial resistance as important in human medicine and 29% believed antimicrobial use in pets posed a risk for antimicrobial resistance in humans. Participants recruited through social media, and those in the highest education category, were significantly more likely to report antimicrobial use in pets as a risk to people. Clinical Significance: Cost was the most important factor in dog-owner antimicrobial preferences.

The purpose of this system is to identify topic-based opinion leaders of social media. In order to accomplish this goal, several steps have been taken, such as data collection, data processing, data analysis, data classification, ranking of topic-based opinion leaders, and evaluation. The SNOL system has two main parts. In the first part, collected tweets are classified by semantic kernels for topic-based analysis. In the second part, leadership scores are given to each user in the network according to topic modeling and user modeling results. Leadership scores are then calculated with the formula generated and opinion leaders are determined for each category. Experiments are performed on data gathered from Twitter including 17,234,924 tweets from 38,727 users. The evaluation of opinion leader detection is a difficult job since there is no standard method for identifying opinion leaders. Therefore, the evaluation of the results of this study has been done using two different methods, retweet count and spread score, to prove that the suggested methodology outperforms the PageRank algorithm. The results have also been evaluated considering the user-topic sentiment correlation of the retrieved lists. Furthermore, SNOL has been compared against some opinion leader detection methods previously presented in the literature. The experimental results show that SNOL generates remarkably higher performance than the PageRank algorithm and other existing algorithms in the literature for nearly all topics and all selected top N opinion leaders. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The Layla’s Got You campaign consists of a chatbot and social media campaign designed to increase contraception knowledge among 16- to 25-year-old Black and Hispanic women in Onondaga County. Methods: The campaign was co-created with local women in the target audience and employed digital and grassroots community building strategies. Focus groups were conducted among 31 women, during which participants selected the campaign’s logo and chatbot name and created the tagline. Participants reviewed chatbot responses and designed Layla’s appearance and features, and Black/Hispanic women are featured in website and promotional photos. A community campaign manager pairs digital strategies with grassroots partnerships among a diverse group of stakeholders, including social media influencers, hair salons and health clinics. Results: Since implementation, the chatbot has received 4,390 messages related to contraception or sexual health. Across social media accounts, the campaign has showed 2,483,683 impressions, average daily reach of 1,710 for Facebook and 943 for Instagram, and 32,816 total engagements across all platforms. Conclusion: Layla’s Got You provides young women with a confidential place in which to find locally tailored and trustworthy information about contraception. By merging innovative technology-driven strategies, participatory creation techniques and grassroots community building, the initiative delivers impactful, easily updated health information on a large scale. This strategy has promising implications for increasing knowledge and positive attitudes towards contraception among specific at-risk audiences. © The Author(s) 2020."

Contemporary social media offers almost everyone a platform to publish one’s own thoughts, opinions, political statements and others, some of which may gain significant interest of others and thereby become so called “influencers”. This role has in the past been held by news agencies primarily, but this role is increasingly adopted also by private people and among them, also some who do not necessarily adhere the high standards of good journalism or scientific ethics. These give rise to fake news, spreading as unconfirmed rumors and possibly causing dramatic impacts to a society. With information available almost everywhere in the internet today, the distinction between good and bad sources has become a challenge, and highly difficult task. Even more intricate is the question of verifying information against multiple independent sources. If many people say something, does this make it true or any more plausible? Do we need to trust information in lack of better information? Is it possible to judge information and make our own opinion about its validity, quality, relevance or usefulness for our own business? This article shall provide pointers towards answers to the above questions. We discuss some technical means of judging the quality of information and what anyone, even without much technical background can do to avoid falling victim to fake information and fake news. © 2020, The Author(s)."

The corporate diplomacy phenomenon, however, needs additional examination in the more collectivistic East Asia context. This study investigates a public–private partnership in which a corporation sponsors a cultural exchange project in Japan, specifically how Japanese business leaders perceive and integrate promoting national interests and country image into corporate strategy. This research analyzes the New Tohoku program that brings foreign students, businesspersons, and social media influencers to Tohoku, a region undergoing reconstruction since the 2011 tsunami, to learn about Japan’s economy, history, climate, and culture. Interviews with executives and managers and documentary information from corporate webpages, news releases, and promotional brochures reveal motivations for engaging to (1) promote Japan’s culture, (2) stimulate economic growth, and (3) generate awareness about Pasona through publicity. While unrelated to Pasona’s business model, New Tohoku reflects the “Japanese mindset” of helping Japan; the founder, employees, and shareholders ensure this remains a strategic objective regardless of profits.

Results suggest that influencer-product congruence can be used to enhance product attitude and reduce advertising recognition by generating a higher affective motive inference. Sponsorship disclosure can also affect product attitude in a serial mediation of calculative motive inference and advertising recognition.

In the separation of vertical media (media which are still aiming for a wide audience with content of general relevance) and horizontal media (more specific media actors building a community around the content they produce), comedians can be considered actors in horizontal media, who help provide the community agenda. This study compares how comedians in horizontal media frame news and current affairs with how journalists in vertical media frame similar news. The study is performed via a quantitative content analysis of Swedish political comedy and traditional Swedish news coverage, with a focus on the emerging podcast medium. It shows that the comedic framing is dramatically more personal and emotional. It is also more thematic and more often on a societal level, while the journalistic news framing is more episodic and on an individual level. The comedic framing is also more focused on issues of political figures and processes, more negative, and more inclusive of different types of societal actors when compared to the news reporting of vertical media. © The Author(s) 2018."

As a part of social media marketing activities, digital influencers (DIs) became useful for the endorsement of brands (Jimenes-Castillo & Sanchez-Fernandez, 2019) as they create a link between the company and the consumer, and spread persuasive messages (Kapitan & Silvera, 2016). Furthermore, DIs are considered to be opinion-leaders as they are sources of valuable and believable information which also improves the dissemination and impact of the messages they create (De Veirman, et al., 2017). Therefore, using DIs is desirable for companies as these individuals have the power to influence and persuade consumers to purchase endorsed brands (Childers et al., 2018; Lou & Yuan, 2019), and also help the company to improve their brand image and brand value (Casalo et al., 2018; Uzunoglu & Kip, 2014). This supports the view that DIs nowadays are considered to be extensions, and thus valuable resources, of organizations to represent the efficient sources of electronic word-of-mouth (King et al., 2014). This perspective fits well with two well-known theories of marketing known as Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) and Resource-Based View (RBV) where DIs are recognized as new resources for the companies to establish marketing communication success and competitive advantage. Considering the SDL perspective, DIs' strategies and actions are dynamic resources and interdependent processes which trigger value co-creation and collaboration. However, to create value, there needs to be a fit between the brand and the influencer, and as suggested by Voorveld (2019), despite being less popular, this fit may help theory development and provide significant insight for practitioners. Frameworks and proposals are needed in the field of DIs and the strategic communication perspective is suggested as a fruitful starting point for the development of theoretical approaches (Borchers, 2019; Voorveld, 2019). Accordingly, this study aims to provide an integrated framework for the interaction between the companies and digital influencers through the employment of the multiple theoretical perspectives of marketing, namely the solutions, SDL and RBV. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Using these methods, I quantify the prevalence of dark patterns in three studies and show how dark patterns are rampant on the web, thus a pressing concern for society. First, I examine whether social media content creators, or ""influencers,""disclose their relationships with advertisers to their audience. Analyzing over 500K YouTube videos and 2.1M Pinterest pins, I find that only about 10% of all advertising content is disclosed to users. Second, I examine various types of dark patterns in shopping websites. Analyzing data from 11K shopping websites, I discover over 1,800 dark patterns on over 1,200 websites that mislead users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. Third, I examine dark patterns in political emails from the 2020 U.S. election cycle. Through an analysis of over 100K emails, I find that over 40% of emails from the median sender contain dark patterns that nudge recipients to open emails or make donations they might otherwise not make.

Prior work has analyzed online help-seeking and help-providing messages during crisis situations, however, it is not clear why and how people commented on help-seeking posts to provide support, especially in such a crisis support community. In this study, we interviewed 23 commenters in the COVID-19 super-topic to examine their motivations and strategies for commenting. Our findings showed that geographical proximity and expertise level affected users' commenting behaviors. For example, non-locals or people lacking professional knowledge applied a ""copy-and-paste""strategy and acted as a bridge between help-seekers and influencers on social media, while locals and experts focused on detailed information and provided targeted help. Some commenters also exhibited avoidance behaviors due to their sense of powerlessness and frustration in such a long-lasting pandemic.

Methods: We performed a retrospective mixed-methods analysis of publicly available Twitter data derived from the publicly available ""Coronavirus Tweet IDs"" dataset, March 3, 2020-May 1, 2020. Original tweets and modified retweets in the dataset by 50 influential EM Twitter users in the US were analyzed using linguistic software to report the emotional tone and temporal viewpoint. We qualitatively analyzed a 25% random subsample and report themes. Results: There were 1315 tweets available in the dataset from 36/50 influential EM Twitter users in the US. The majority of tweets were either positive (455/1315, 34.6%) or neutral (407/1315, 31%) in tone and focused on the present (1009/1315, 76.7%). Qualitative analysis identified six distinct themes, with users most often sharing news or clinical information. Conclusions: During the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, influential EM Twitter users in the US delivered mainly positive or neutral messages, most often pertaining to news stories or information directly relating to patient care. The majority of these messages led to engagement by other users. This study underscores how EM influencers can leverage social media in public health outbreaks to bring attention to topics of importance. © 2021 eScholarship. All rights reserved."

Among these are eating disorders. The current study aim was to assess the prevalence of the symptoms of eating disorders in patrons of sport centers in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and its association with patrons' sociodemographic, and exercise characteristics, as well as social media use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 560 sport center clients. The Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), as well as questions on sociodemographic, exercise, and the use of the social media was collected through self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared test, and Fischer's exact tests were performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of the symptoms of eating disorders was found to be 36.6% according to the results of the EAT-26. There were no significant differences in the rates of eating disorders between genders. Frequencies of eating disorder symptoms increased with an increase in the body mass index of the participants. In addition, more than half of the participants who were pressured by social media to be slim and perceived that social media influencers motivated them to go to the gym had eating disorders' symptoms. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of eating disorders symptoms was high among the sport center patrons examined. The findings from this study might help family physicians, mental health professionals, and sport medicine specialists wishing to understand this issue in Arab populations. Developing strategies regarding mental health in sport center patrons are suggested. In addition, a screening program is recommended for this population to identify those who need further evaluation and management. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved."

However, it is often difficult to identify these 'HIV influencers' who are qualified and willing to promote HIV campaigns, especially online, because social media influencers change frequently. We sought to use an iterative deep learning framework to automatically discover HIV-related online social influencers. DESIGN AND METHOD: Out of 1.15 million Twitter users' data from March 2018 to March 2020, we extracted tweets from 1099 Twitter users who had mentioned the keywords 'HIV' or 'AIDS'. Two Twitter users determined to be 'online HIV influencers' based on their conversation topics and engagement were hand-picked by domain experts and used as a seed training dataset. We modelled social influence and discovered new potential influencers based on these seeds using a graph neural network model. We tested the model's precision and recall compared with other baseline model approaches. We validated the results through manual verification. RESULTS: The model identified 23 new (manually verified) HIV-related influencers, including health and research organizations and local HIV advocates across the United States. Our proposed model achieved the highest accuracy/recall, with an average improvement of 38.5% over the other baseline models. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that iterative deep learning models can be used to automatically identify new and changing key HIV-related influencers online. We discuss the implications and potential of HIV researchers/departments applying this approach across online big data (e.g. hundreds of millions of social media posts per day) to help promote HIV prevention campaigns to affected communities.

The authors investigate the role of online social media tools in alleviating customer (farmer) uncertainty and promoting the adoption of a new eco-friendly pesticide in rural China via a randomized controlled field experiment. The key finding is that even for a new product such as a pesticide, a low-cost social media support platform can effectively promote adoption. A combination of information from peers and from the firm on the platform facilitates learning about product features and alleviates uncertainty associated with product quality and appropriate product usage. Nevertheless, at the trial stage of the funnel, the platform underperforms the firm’s customized one-on-one support because available information does not resolve uncertainty in supplier credibility and product authenticity. Having an influencer on the platform, albeit not an expert on this product, vouching for its credibility helps resolve this funnel-holdup problem. From a theoretical perspective, this paper provides suggestive evidence for referent influence and credibility signaling on social media platforms and consequences for new product trial. The authors also provide direct empirical evidence on how information facilitates learning, a phenomenon typically assumed to be present in studies estimating learning models. © The Author(s) 2021."

No discipline has benefitted from another as much as marketing from psychology. To gain an understanding of the scientific contributions emerging from the intersection of psychology and marketing, this study conducts a bibliometric retrospection of a premier journal dedicated to the application of psychological theories and techniques to marketing: Psychology & Marketing (P&M). To do so, this study employs bibliometrics to unpack the publication trends and the intellectual structure of P&M. In doing so, this study reveals several interesting findings. First, P&M's publications grew by 71.9 times, authorships grew by 82.1 times, and citations grew by 150.8 times between 1984 and 2020, indicating a healthy growth of marketing research informed by psychology. Second, P&M's contributions manifest through eight intellectual clusters—namely, marketing environment; consumer engagement; online consumer behavior and marketing; luxury consumption and marketing; sustainable consumption and marketing; influencer and international marketing; customer relationship, satisfaction, and loyalty; and marketing futures. Finally, P&M's emerging and promising areas for future exploration include aesthetics and consumer impressions; celebrity endorsement; conspicuous consumption and hedonic adaptation; climate change; choice likelihood; consumer engagement; consumer psychology; marketing communication; sensory marketing; sharing economy; and social media marketing. As a whole, these findings should provide readers with a state-of-the-art overview of marketing from psychology through the scientific contributions from P&M. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC"

The development has been criticized for upholding a view in which structural inequalities are explained in terms of individual choices; choice feminism. This article examines two professional groups, lifestyle influencers and gender equality consultants. The purpose is to examine how questions of feminism, choice and entrepreneurship are made sense of in these contexts. The article situates the interviewees' explanations in fourth, or even fifth wave feminism to examine whether the embrace of choice still relies on a critique of gender structures and inequalities. Both the consultants and the influencers felt that entrepreneurial success had changed the way society viewed them. The appeal of ‘choice’ was an outcome of a perceived lack of choice, a matter of performing resistance to the culturally defined choices these individuals felt were presented to them.

The article examines the materiality of platform labour and the local informal economy that give rise to these forms of brokerage. I also describe how brokerage processes set norms and standards in this largely unregulated sector, thereby playing a role in how labour mobility or precarity are made possible and organised.

The study contributes to a growing body of work on the sociolinguistics of crisis communication. We focus on the use of South and Southeast Asian languages, spoken largely by blue-collar migrant workers, which are often seen as peripheral even though they are spoken by a large segment of the population. The deployment of these languages during Qatar's COVID-19 awareness campaign assumes further significance against the backdrop of a series of measures taken by the government in the last few years to strengthen the status and use of Arabic. We analyze multilingual printed pamphlets, multilingual audio-visual communication through radio and social media, as well as interviews conducted with key figures who were part of the awareness campaign. Our examination of the availability, accessibility, acceptability, and adaptability of the multilingual awareness materials reveals that while the different languages and modes of communication were important in spreading awareness, equally critical, if not more, was who carried the information and in what forms.

The objective of this analysis is to characterize the profile of radiation oncology–related tweets and Twitter users over the past 6 years. Methods and Materials: Using the web-based social media analytics platform Symplur Signals, we filtered tweets containing at least 1 of the following hashtags or key words: #radonc, #radiationoncology, “rad onc,” or “radiation oncology.” We evaluated radiation oncology–related Twitter activity between October 2014 and March 2020 for tweet frequency, tweet content, and individuals or groups posting tweets. We identified the most influential Twitter users contributing to radiation oncology–related tweets. Results: From 2014 to 2020, the quarterly volume of radiation oncology–related tweets increased from 5027 to 29,763. Physicians contributed the largest growth in tweet volume. Academic radiation oncologists comprise 60% of the most influential Twitter accounts responsible for radiation oncology–related content. The number of radiation-oncology resident physicians on Twitter increased from 25 to 328 over the past 6 years, and 20% of radiation-oncology residency programs have a Twitter account.

It has been widely reported in the media that IQOS is an acronym for 'I quit ordinary smoking'. To our knowledge, PMI has never publicly used any acronym to describe or market IQOS. Moreover, PMI has repeatedly denied that IQOS is an acronym. The acronym, which is an implicit cessation claim, has also appeared in numerous peer-reviewed publications. While the origins of the acronym are unknown, PMI stands to benefit from the publicity and associated positive connotations. It is possible that early adopters of IQOS created the acronym online, which was then picked by reporters and the research community.

Consequently, visuality and social media platforms like Twitter have come to play a vital role in disseminating prevention messages widely. Yet to date, only little is known about what characterizes visual risk communication during the Covid-19 pandemic. To address this gap in the literature, this study's objective was to determine how visual risk communication was used on Twitter to promote the World Health Organisations (WHO) recommended preventative behaviours and how this communication changed over time. METHODS: We sourced Twitter's 500 most retweeted Covid-19 messages for each month from January-October 2020 using Crowdbreaks. For inclusion, tweets had to have visuals, be in English, come from verified accounts, and contain one of the keywords 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'corona', or 'covid'. Following a retrospective approach, we then performed a qualitative content analysis of the 616 tweets meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Our results show communication dynamics changed over the course of the pandemic. At the start, most retweeted preventative messages came from the media and health and government institutions, but overall, personal accounts with many followers (51.3%) predominated, and their tweets had the highest spread (10.0%, i.e., retweet count divided by followers). Messages used mostly photographs and images were found to be rich with information. 78.1% of Tweets contained 1-2 preventative messages, whereby 'stay home' and 'wear a mask' frequented most. Although more tweets used health loss framing, health gain messages spread more. CONCLUSION: Our findings can inform the didactics of future crisis communication. The results underscore the value of engaging individuals, particularly influencers, as advocates to spread health risk messages and promote solidarity. Further, our findings on the visual characteristic of the most retweeted tweets highlight factors that health and government organisations should consider when creating visual health messages for Twitter. However, that more tweets used the emotive medium of photographs often combined with health loss framing raises concerns about persuasive tactics. More research is needed to understand the implications of framing and its impact on public perceptions and behaviours."

Changes in the way Millennials think accompanied by an explosion of social media have led to an increased focus on social media influencer marketing in the company sector. To help establish a new marketing paradigm that accounts for these changes, this research aims to conceptualize and investigate the process of building consumer-brand relationships with Millennial consumers through social media micro-influencers. Findings based on structural equation modeling revealed that four core characteristics of social media micro-influencers (i.e., authenticity, the meaning of the influencer, specific content, and secret sharing) were a significant antecedent of brand engagement and brand love, which, in turn, mediated the pathway from social media micro-influencer characteristics to brand evangelism. Understanding what social media micro-influencers mean to Millennials offers the promise of improving brand evangelism through more precise market analysis and market strategy. In the discussion, the paper introduces a three-stage building method towards brand evangelism through social media micro-influencer, including: (1) the stage of selecting influencers; (2) the stage of constructing intense emotional responses to the brand (brand engagement and brand love); and ultimately (3) the stage of becoming a brand evangelist.

Influence is no longer concentrated in the hands of an elite few: social networks have distributed power across a broader set of tastemakers. To understand this new landscape of influence, we created FITNet - - a network of the top 10k influencers of the larger Twitter fashion graph. To construct FITNet, we trained a content-based classifier to identify fashion-relevant Twitter accounts. Leveraging this classifier, we estimated the size of Twitter's fashion subgraph, snowball sampled more than 300k fashion-related accounts based on following relationships, and identified the top 10k influencers in the resulting subgraph. We use FITNet to perform a large-scale analysis of fashion influencers, and demonstrate how the network facilitates discovery, surfacing influencers relevant to specific fashion topics that may be of interest to brands, retailers, and media companies. © 2021 ACM."

Since equestrianism is one of the most popular sports in Sweden and Norway, influencers' social media communication greatly impacts followers' perception of the human-animal relationship. Despite the popularity of equestrian sports, studies thereof are rare, and research combining equestrian sports and social media is almost non-existent, making this study important and relevant. The analysis focuses on the six biggest equestrian influencers in Sweden and Norway and their social media accounts. Goffman's (1967) micro-sociological perspectives, alongside previous research on social media, are used to discuss knowledge exchange, co-creation of authenticity and intimacy and sponsorship and advertisement. The influencers mainly focus their communication on horse-related issues, and their (and their followers) love of horses create the intimacy needed as a base for other messages (perceived knowledge and advertisement). The intimacy and authenticity are strengthened in the interaction between followers and influencers, and the latter receive positive feedback for their way of handling their horses' lives. The expressive order of stable culture(s) is seldom questioned and the acceptance of this order is likely to make the commercial endorsements less visible and more convincing.

Furthermore, teachers are compared to both social influencers and social engineers to reflect the positive and negative potentials of teacher influence. The author also shares an account to demonstrate a person who most influenced him-James Jones, an elementary principal.

Design/methodology/approach: Using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) with content analysis, the authors examine over 20,000 online communication posts to identify prospects’ needs and communication styles that may inform brand ambassadors’ outreach efforts. Findings: Analysis reveals linguistic differences between brand ambassadors’ and prospective students’ posts across public and private spaces, suggesting gaps in exchange efficacy. Publicly, prospects express more positive emotion, affiliation and authenticity than in private posts, where posting engagement is the highest. Prospects overall low clout language, combined with brand ambassadors’ low authenticity scores, suggest limited influence in exchange efforts. Theoretically, findings suggest that given the hedonic nature of public exchanges, this is where brand ambassadors may be more influential than in private, utilitarian informational exchanges. An integrated influencer marketing servicescape model is developed to guide future research. Originality/value: Findings extend and integrate the online servicescape and influencer marketing literatures by revealing the importance of service interaction context and linguistic styles in enhancing frontline informational exchanges. Aligning linguistic language such as analytical thought, clout, authenticity, emotional tone, temporal focus and affiliation between public and private contexts may enhance authenticity in frontline service interactions, thereby enhancing communication effectiveness. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Thus, the present study constitutes the first exploratory analysis of YouTube videos in Spanish related to this procedure. A preliminary analysis of 221 YouTube videos yielded a final sample of the 50 most viewed videos within this genre. The analysis was carried out through a quantitative content analysis assessing the popularity of the videos, contact and emotive strategies by the creator, the credibility conveyed, and the characteristics of information about the procedure itself. Results suggest that these influencers align with mainstream Internet celebrity culture in practices that aim at increasing their following and views, as well as calls for subscriptions and visits to other platforms and profiles. Moreover, they include different strategies to establish their credibility but emphasize personal experience.

Since then, tireless efforts have been made to mitigate the spread of the disease and its impact, and these efforts have mostly relied on nonpharmaceutical interventions. By December 2020, the safety and efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines were demonstrated. The large social media platform Twitter has been used by medical researchers for the analysis of important public health topics, such as the public's perception on antibiotic use and misuse and human papillomavirus vaccination. The analysis of Twitter-generated data can be further facilitated by using Twitter's built-in, anonymous polling tool to gain insight into public health issues and obtain rapid feedback on an international scale. During the fast-paced course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Twitter polling system has provided a viable method for gaining rapid, large-scale, international public health insights on highly relevant and timely SARS-CoV-2-related topics. Objective: The purpose of this study was to understand the public's perception on the safety and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in real time by using Twitter polls. Methods: We developed 2 Twitter polls to explore the public's views on available COVID-19 vaccines. The surveys were pinned to the Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform Twitter timeline for 1 week in mid-February 2021, and Twitter users and influencers were asked to participate in and retweet the polls to reach the largest possible audience. Results: The adequacy of COVID-19 vaccine safety (ie, the safety of currently available vaccines; poll 1) was agreed upon by 1579 out of 3439 (45.9%) Twitter users. In contrast, almost as many Twitter users (1434/3439, 41.7%) were unsure about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Only 5.2% (179/3439) of Twitter users rated the available COVID-19 vaccines as generally unsafe. Poll 2, which addressed the question of whether users would undergo vaccination, was answered affirmatively by 82.8% (2862/3457) of Twitter users, and only 8% (277/3457) categorically rejected vaccination at the time of polling. Conclusions: In contrast to the perceived high level of uncertainty about the safety of the available COVID-19 vaccines, we observed an elevated willingness to undergo vaccination among our study sample. Since people's perceptions and views are strongly influenced by social media, the snapshots provided by these media platforms represent a static image of a moving target. Thus, the results of this study need to be followed up by long-term surveys to maintain their validity. This is especially relevant due to the circumstances of the fast-paced pandemic and the need to not miss sudden rises in the incidence of vaccine hesitancy, which may have detrimental effects on the pandemic's course. © Fabian Eibensteiner, Valentin Ritschl, Faisal A Nawaz, Sajjad S Fazel, Christos Tsagkaris, Stefan Tino Kulnik, Rik Crutzen, Elisabeth Klager, Sabine Völkl-Kernstock, Eva Schaden, Maria Kletecka-Pulker, Harald Willschke, Atanas G Atanasov.

We aim to investigate the use of Twitter, enhanced conference experience, and education at the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Annual Scientific Assembly 2016-2020. Methods: EAST hashtags were analyzed for the Annual Scientific Assembly 2016-2020: #EAST2016, #EAST2017, #EAST2018, #EAST2019, and #EAST2020. Using #EAST2016 as a baseline, active interaction through engagement, measured by tweets and retweets, passive interaction through impressions, measured by views, as well as users, and influencers were analyzed. Results: 2016-2018 saw a significant increase in engagement (7400 to 9200 to 11 000, respectively, P <.05). 2018-2020 then showed a significant decrease in engagement (11 000 to 9000 to 6700, respectively, P <.05). Impressions, increased significantly from 2016 to 2020 (6.6 million to 13.3 million to 12.6 million to 19.9 million to 20.3 million, respectively, P <.05). Users significantly increased to 2700 in 2018 compared with 1000 in 2016 (P <.05), and significantly decreased to 814 in 2020 compared with 2700 in 2018 (P <.05). The top online influencer was the EAST organization Twitter account. Conclusion: #EAST2016-2018 showed a significant increase in engagement between users, measured by tweets/retweets. However, #EAST2019-2020 suffered declines in users’ engagement, maybe a result of social media fatigue. Although, #EAST2016-2020 showed a significant increase in impressions. Both passive and to a more extent active forms of online social media engagement can potentially disseminate new knowledge and medical information.

The aim of this study is to understand the transmedia music phenomenon due to the impact of music on the platform. To this end, we applied a methodology that stemmed from Grounded Theory principles in the analysis of 300 Disney animation song covers in three stages: (1) deductive and inductive codebook development; (2) social network analysis; and (3) statistical test. The results showed that youtubers highlight specific audiovisual codes from the film and cultural industries.

Both digital and social media can propagate healthcare misinformation and thus affect vaccine policy support. The use of social media monitoring to understand real-time public perceptions of One Health policies is crucial to identify misinformation and address public concerns appropriately to achieve successful policy implementation. Digital and social media data surrounding two government announcements regarding the bovine tuberculosis eradication strategy for England were collected and screened using the Meltwater media monitoring platform. Communication patterns were studied using InfraNodus. Twitter analysis was conducted to identify key influencers, public engagement, and trending communications. Online social media activity increased rapidly after each announcement. Initially, badger culling took primary public concern and major influencers were identified. Cattle vaccination dominated discussion after the second announcement, with public perception being influenced by increased online activity from news sites, animal welfare charities, governmental bodies, and medical professionals. The greatest ambiguity towards the strategy was detected within farming communities, with the main disparity existing between cattle vaccination and badger culling opinions.

Aims and Methods: Participants were 135 adolescents of age 13-18 (52.6% female, mean age = 15.3) in California. Participants viewed six social media posts online in a 2 (post source: peer or advertisement) × 2 (e-cigarette content exposure: heavy or light) between-subjects design. Analyses were weighted to population benchmarks. We examined adolescents' beliefs, willingness, and intention to use e-cigarettes in association with social media use intensity in daily life and with experimentally manipulated exposure to social media posts that varied by source (peer or advertisement) and content (e-cigarette heavy or light). Results: Greater social media use in daily life was associated with greater willingness and intention to use e-cigarettes and more positive attitudes, greater perceived norms, and lower perceived danger of e-cigarette use (all p-values <.01). In tests of the experimental exposures, heavy (vs. light) e-cigarette content resulted in greater intention (p =.049) to use e-cigarettes and more positive attitudes (p = .019). Viewing advertisements (vs. peer-generated posts) resulted in greater willingness and intention (p-values <.01) to use e-cigarettes, more positive attitudes (p =.003), and greater norm perceptions (p = .009). The interaction effect of post source by post content was not significant for any of the outcomes (all p-values >.529). Conclusions: Greater social media use and heavier exposure to advertisements and e-cigarette content in social media posts are associated with a greater risk for e-cigarette use among adolescents. Regulatory action is needed to prohibit sponsored e-cigarette content on social media platforms used by youth. Implications: Adolescents who use social media intensely may be at higher risk for e-cigarette use. Even brief exposure to e-cigarette content on social media was associated with greater intention to use and more positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes.

What initially started off as a way to socially associate people at an individual level has in its journey become a platform for doing business easily. It is currently a huge ring to associate and network across the globe. Sonia Konjeti Agarwal has weaved a comparable success story utilizing Facebook. Her story, like that of Facebook, started with a motive to socially connect people of a geographical area. She created a Facebook group for women in Pune and christened it PULA (Pune Ladies Association), which has now become a vibrant business platform. Research Questions: i. Social entrepreneurs are change agents. In the context of social entrepreneurship which is most important: initiation of an idea, transmission of idea or creating a sustainable impact? ii. Social media is a powerful tool for networking. How did PULA strategically leverage social media for real time interactions and entrepreneurial ventures? Link to Theory: This case draws linkage to Social Cognitive Theory. Social Cognitive theory depicts bidirectional character of causation where behavior, cognitive, emotional factors and environment persistently and jointly persuade each other. Role of the protagonist in creating an exciting platform for indigenous entrepreneurs through the path of social entrepreneurship is linked here. Phenomenon Studied: Social entrepreneurship is a promising field with diverse interpretations. As a social entrepreneur, Sonia’s efforts are directed towards strengthening the identity of indigenous entrepreneurs. She initiated small venture creations within social network. Growth of indigenous entrepreneurs ignites self dependency and magnetizes new investments. Success of the virtual community to hone entrepreneurial skills is studied. Case context - As a social entrepreneur, the protagonist used Facebook to create virtual community of indigenous (women) entrepreneurs. PULA enhanced visibility, reach, network and prominence of indigenous entrepreneurs at low cost. Opportunity to interact with buyers directly expanded vendor registration in the group. It also created level playing field for first generation entrepreneurs. Findings: This case depicts pragmatism of the social entrepreneur. PULA unified the virtual community and resources fostering entrepreneurship. This virtual community signifies uniqueness of domain, novel practices and policies. PULA was initially constituted for social networking. Gradually members discovered business opportunities. Efficacy of social media for virtual engagement and small venture creation resulted in financial independence for women. Status of women transitioned to indigenous entrepreneur from homemaker. Growth of indigenous entrepreneurs being contagious, a wave of first generation entrepreneurs was born. Discussions: PULA encouraged individuals hitherto in the veil of self imposed life situations to become entrepreneurs. Sonia was zealous about empowering women, to create opportunities for them to succeed and advance in lives. As a social influencer her actions are directed towards social well being. Her primary objective is to leverage the trust shown by two hundred forty-five thousand plus members and six thousand five hundred plus verified sellers. Non existence of tangible and quantifiable metrics for measuring the performance of the social entrepreneur creates a challenge. Sonia is exploring new social media engagement strategies for creating a sustainable virtual community. © 2021 SAGE Publications."

We explore how social media discourse about COVID-19 in Italy was affected by the rapid spread of the virus, and how themes in postings changed with the adoption of social distancing measures and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). We used topic modeling and social network analysis to highlight critical dimensions of conversations around COVID-19: 1) topics in social media postings about the Coronavirus; 2) the scope and reach of social networks; and 3) changes in social media content as the nation moved from partial to full social distancing. Twitter messages sent in Italy between February 11th and March 10th, 2020. 74,306 Tweets sent by institutions, news sources, elected officials, scientists and social media influencers. Messages were retweeted more than 1.2 million times globally. Non-parametric chi-square statistic with residual analysis to identify categories, chi-square test for linear trend, and Social Network Graphing. The first phase of the pandemic was dominated by social media influencers, followed by a focus on the economic consequences of the virus and placing blame on immigrants. As the crisis deepened, science-based themes began to predominate, with a focus on reducing the spread of the virus through physical distancing and business closures Our findings highlight the importance of messaging in social media in gaining the public’s trust and engagement during a pandemic. This requires credible scientific voices to garner public support for effective mitigation. Fighting the spread of an infectious disease goes hand in hand with stemming the dissemination of lies, bad science, and misdirection. © 2021, The Author(s)."

The scale of the problem requires innovative approaches to bring about change. One such approach is the development of a sustainable food system in combination with the leadership of Pacific youth. This study sought to engage Pacific youth as part of the solution to reducing NCDs through social enterprise and championing of sustainable food systems. Four young Fijian vegetable and fruit entrepreneurs shared their stories as part of a participatory action research of Talanoa/storytelling, with social media workshops, networking and promotional opportunities. Findings revealed that youth entrepreneurs are passionate about food and health, family and tradition; some are already food influencers and champions and they are keen to grow their businesses. Yet, there is limited support for small business development with a social purpose and youth-led campaigns. The study indicates a growing potential to develop local youth-led social entrepreneurship and innovation to address NCDs in exciting new ways. There is an urgent need to support innovation interventions to advocate for sustainable food systems for the Pacific, that promote positive human health needs and address, more broadly, climate change effects. © 2020 The Author(s)."

As there are different platforms of social participation, we present a taxonomy to unify the different classifications and delimit the scope of our work. Influencers could produce a positive externality of increasing participation by suggesting social causes and government actions they believe in. However, influencers tend to restrict their posts to the domain subject they became popular for. Our goal is to identify the cost structure of posting behavior of influencers, from the desire to post to the actual act of posting. The findings indicate the two key factors influencers consider when posting are (a) the risk of losing followers and (b) the effort required to verify the information. On the other hand, followers indicate they like it when influencers voice their opinion on social causes. These findings are anchored on social influence theory. We also found different factors that motivate/demotivate people to post on social media. We noticed that the factors that will motivate a user to post can either be aroused in him (i.e., already internalized in the person) or can be “planted” in the person (i.e., from outside). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature."

YouTube is one of the most popular social media platforms for young people in the United Kingdom, and YouTubers are the most important influencers on the platform producing diverse health content. They are increasingly recognized by popular media and public health organizations as a potentially influential source of health information for young people. This study aimed to qualitatively explore young people’s experiences and perceptions of YouTuber health content. Focus groups (November 2017 to January 2018) with 85 young people (13–18 years) were recruited from schools in a single county in North West England. The findings suggest young people’s engagement with YouTuber health content is dependent on how they encounter it, YouTubers’ motivations for producing it, and the perceived relatability, sincerity, and generalization present in this content. The study confirms YouTuber health content was one of the many sources of health information used by young people and was most frequently encountered during young people’s routine viewing. Collaboration between public health organizations and YouTubers could be promising in communicating health messages to young people already engaged with these YouTubers, as part of wider campaigns or interventions. These messages could be particularly effective if they focused on experiences and norms rather than advice, remained consistent with YouTubers’ existing health content, incorporate clear indicators of accuracy into their narrative, and state their intention to benefit young people. © 2020 The Author(s)."

More specifically, the effects of message appeal (sensual vs guilt) and message source (hotel vs social media influencer [SMI]) on perceived environmental corporate social responsibility and the intention to stay at the eco-friendly hotel were examined. Design/methodology/approach: Three studies using the experimental design were carried out. Study 1 examined the relationship between message appeal (sensual vs guilt), perceived environmental social corporate responsibility and the intention to stay at the eco-friendly hotel when the hotel posts sustainability messages on social media. Study 2 replicated Study 1 findings when the SMI posts sustainability messages. Study 3 examined the moderating role of message source (hotel vs influencer) in the effects of message appeal (sensual vs guilt) on behavioral intentions. Findings: Sustainability messages with the sensual (vs guilt) appeal are more persuasive when the eco-friendly hotel (vs SMI) posts it on social media. Furthermore, the traveler’s perception of the hotel’s environmental corporate social responsibility mediates this relationship. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the literature on sustainability communication by demonstrating the role of message source and message appeal in influencing the traveler’s perceptions and intentions toward eco-friendly hotels. Practical implications: According to the study findings, eco-friendly hotels can motivate travelers to make pro-sustainable choices by accurately matching the message appeal with the message source in the sustainability communication on social media. Originality/value: This study is one of the earliest studies that examine the congruency effect of message appeal and message source for sustainability communication on social media in the hospitality realm. The findings offer novel insights for eco-friendly hotels to develop effective sustainability communication on social media. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

It provides insights into role of social media in marketing luxury in ‘new’ markets (African cities) and the complexities attendant to the relationship between brand representatives and influencers. It reports on in-depth interviews with brand representatives and social media influ-encers working in the luxury sector in large anglophone African cities. Empirical findings show the role of social media in how luxury is promoted by those working in the industry. Three key complexities to do with value, trust and authenticity were evident in how global brand representatives and local influencers discussed social media. In terms of value, influencers emphasize strategies for monetizing visibility, while brand managers emphasize the need to get their money’s worth. Regarding trust, influencers express caution about brands trying to exploit them, while brands express scepticism about the extent of influencer’s abilities. On the topic of authenticity, influencers emphasize how the integrity of their personal brands is paramount, while brand representatives are mostly concerned with how genuine the social media posts seem. The article provides original empirical details about the relationships between brand managers and social media influenc-ers, as well as to the nuances of social media luxury marketing in African cities.

These amateur micro-influencers have achieved a modicum of fame through their charismatic appeal and niche expertise, by focusing on a very narrow domain of interest within a large set of product and service categories. The growing popularity of micro-influencers has not escaped the attention of online fashion and streetwear marketers, like Asos, Boohoo, and Fashion Nova, who have coopted them to present their offerings on social platforms, like Instagram, using rich, visually appealing content, often modeled by the influencers themselves. This novel marketing and branding approach is highly cost-effective and obviates the need for traditional and expensive push marketing methods like television advertising and celebrity endorsements. Moreover, some of the micro-influencers themselves are now leveraging their social media popularity to launch their own “private fashion brands” on Instagram. These online developments have gained even greater momentum during the time of the pandemic. All such emerging tactics and trends stand to disrupt many mass-market apparel companies like Gap, Zara and H&M.

In today’s world, the traditional model of advertising is dismissed by most consumers.There are underlying subconscious elements, however, that we cannot consciously see but can utilise within marketing and branding.The subconscious areas of the human mind can be leveraged in a way that evokes human emotion to effectively target and build a brand that consumers are proactively looking to engage with.With the introduction of social media, influencers and what I like to call ‘woke advertising’ brands are effectively using ‘emotion’ as a tool to connect with their target audience and not merely create new customers but create customers who are proactively connecting with that brand. It is this emotional connection that allows the brand to take on ‘human-like’ qualities within the eyes of the consumer and create a bond and connection that allow consumers to proactively engage with the brand and create a long-lasting emotional hook.This paper examines how the introduction of new technology and social media allows consumers to ‘talk back’ with brands and have dialogues that create an opportunity for brands to take on human-like characteristics. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS."

To establish the potential of social network theory-based metrics in better understanding public health campaigns, we analyzed real-time user interactions on Twitter during the 2020 World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) as an exemplar case. Social network analysis (SNA), including community and influencer identification, as well as topic modeling were used to compare the activity of n = 29,958 campaign participants and n = 10,694 reference users from the sixmonths pre-campaign period. Users formed more inter-connected relationships during the campaign, retweeting and mentioning each other 46,161 times compared to 10,662 times in the prior six months. Campaign participants formed identifiable communities that were not only based on their geolocation, but also based on interests and professional background. While influencers who dominated the WBW conversations were disproportionally members of the scientific community, the campaign did mobilize influencers from the general public who seemed to play a ""bridging""role between the public and the scientific community. Users communicated about the campaign beyond its original themes to also discuss breastfeeding within the context of social and racial inequities. Applying SNA allowed understanding of the breastfeeding campaign's messaging and engagement dynamics across communities and influencers. Moving forward, WBW could benefit from improving targeting to enhance geographic coverage and user interactions. As this exemplar case indicates, social network theory and analysis can be used to inform other public health campaigns with data on user interactions that go beyond traditional metrics.

However, the anti-vaccination movement is currently on the rise, spreading online misinformation about vaccine safety and causing a worrying reduction in vaccination rates worldwide. In this historical time, it is imperative to understand the reasons of vaccine hesitancy, and to find effective strategies to dismantle the rhetoric of anti-vaccination supporters. For this reason, we analyzed the behavior of anti-vaccination supporters on the platform Twitter. Here we identify that anti-vaccination supporters, in comparison with pro-vaccination supporters, share conspiracy theories and make use of emotional language. We demonstrate that anti-vaccination supporters are more engaged in discussions on Twitter and share their contents from a pull of strong influencers. We show that the movement's success relies on a strong sense of community, based on the contents produced by a small fraction of profiles, with the community at large serving as a sounding board for anti-vaccination discourse to circulate online. Our data demonstrate that Donald Trump, before his profile was suspended, was the main driver of vaccine misinformation on Twitter. Based on these results, we welcome policies that aim at halting the circulation of false information about vaccines by targeting the anti-vaccination community on Twitter.

Limited data exist regarding individuals who control the dialogue. Our goal was to characterize influencers leading the discussion in general surgery. Methods: Right Relevance Insight API was searched for “general surgery,” and individual influencers were ranked by a comprehensive assessment of connections (followers/following) and engagement (likes, retweets, and comments). Profession, specialty, gender, and location were collected utilizing Twitter, Doximity, LinkedIn, ResearchGate, and institutional websites. American Board of Surgery and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada were queried for board certification and academic h-index scores were acquired from Scopus. Results: Eighty-eight individual influencers in general surgery were identified, with 73 holding positions in general surgery. Attending level general surgeons comprised 50%, of which 91% are board certified, and 94% completed a fellowship (surgical oncology, laparoscopic surgery, critical care/trauma, and colorectal surgery). Residents comprised 31%; 11% were nonsurgeons and 3% were not physicians. The majority of residents and fellow influencers were female (72%). Many general surgery influencers were international (51%), particularly Canadian (28% overall). The academic h-indices for these influencers (n = 73) ranged from 0 to 73 (mean 14.5 ± 8.2; median 9.5). Discussion: Our data describe the positions, backgrounds, and research contributions of the top Twitter influencers in general surgery. Those engaged in social media should consider the background, expertise, and motivation of these influencers as the utilization and impact of this platform grows. © The Author(s) 2020."

This has not been systematically investigated for social media. The aim of this study was to identify associations between specific social media content and suicide deaths. Methods: Suicide-related tweets (n = 787) geolocated to Toronto, Canada and originating from the highest level influencers over a 1-year period (July 2015 to June 2016) were coded for general, putatively harmful and putatively protective content. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine whether tweet characteristics were associated with increases or decreases in suicide deaths in Toronto in the 7 days after posting, compared with a 7-day control window. Results: Elements independently associated with increased subsequent suicide counts were tweets about the suicide of a local newspaper reporter (OR = 5.27, 95% CI = [1.27, 21.99]), ‘other’ social causes of suicide (e.g. cultural, relational, legal problems; OR = 2.39, 95% CI = [1.17, 4.86]), advocacy efforts (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = [1.48, 3.70]) and suicide death (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = [1.07, 2.15]). Elements most strongly independently associated with decreased subsequent suicides were tweets about murder suicides (OR = 0.02, 95% CI = [0.002, 0.17]) and suicide in first responders (OR = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.52]). Conclusions: These findings largely comport with the theory of suicide contagion and associations observed with traditional news media. They specifically suggest that tweets describing suicide deaths and/or sensationalized news stories may be harmful while those that present suicide as undesirable, tragic and/or preventable may be helpful.

Subsequently, we conceptually argue that ideal self-congruence is more strongly related to ideal skills and therefore should be more strongly related to perceived competence, and we empirically demonstrate that perceived competence solely mediates the effect of ideal self-congruence on consumer behavior.

This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the two key constructs by combining and comparing them in a model with the moderators of post characteristics, namely post type and correspondent inference. Empirical results from 409 online followers of two Instagram accounts confirm the complementary effects of opinion leadership and parasocial relationship in influencer marketing and reveal the more prominent role of parasocial relationship over opinion leadership in affecting followers’ purchase intention. These effects are moderated by post characteristics. Storytelling posts intensify both effects. Correspondent inference enhances the effect of parasocial relationship, but not that of opinion leadership.

We aim to propose (1) the visual presentation of an Influencer's extroversion as an antecedent to source credibility and purchase intentions and (2) personality matching in terms of extroversion between an Influencer and their audience as a moderator of such relationships. We chose the source credibility model and the similarity-attraction model as our theoretical frameworks. In our controlled online experiment (n = 165), the profile of a brand ambassador of a fashion brand was curated to create two levels of extroversion (i.e. low vs. high extroversion). Participants' self-reported extroversion levels were counterbalanced in these two conditions to create a personality match with the Influencer, entitled “extroversion congruence.” Our results suggest that the visual presentation of an Influencer's extroversion increases the perceived credibility of the Influencer and subsequent purchase intentions. Additionally, our findings show that these relationships were asymmetrically moderated by extroversion congruence: the positive effects of extroversion increase in the case of high extroversion among both the Influencer and their audience but decrease in the case of low extroversion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

We investigated the impact of high versus low popularity influencer images on mood and body dissatisfaction. Adult women (N = 111, aged 17–40) were randomly allocated to one of three groups: either (1) the influencer-high group (idealised imagery alongside high ‘like’/follow metrics); (2) the influencer-low group (the same idealised imagery adjusted for low popularity metrics); or (3) a nature control group with matched low-popularity metrics. Results revealed significantly higher negative mood and body dissatisfaction within the two influencer imagery groups compared with the control group.

Through a multiplatform discourse analysis of two such scandals, this project explores how influencers, brands, and audiences utilize the affordances and norms of social media platforms to manage their roles and relationships throughout these callout campaigns. Four key strategies emerge: curation, critique, reframing, and silence. Despite the efforts of some audiences and influencers, these four strategies elided the broader social implications of brand and influencer racism as members of the community responded to the drama more than they critiqued the marginalization of people of color. Overall, this project provides insight into the dynamics at work in callout campaigns, theorizing the ways in which actors work to balance visibility, risk, labor, and control. © The Author(s) 2020."

It analyses the football club’s Twitter network to discover influential actors and the topic of interest in their online communication. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analysed the social networks derived from over two million tweets collected during football matches played by Manchester United. The authors applied social network analysis to discover influencers and sub-communities and performed content analysis on the most popular tweets of the prominent influencers. Findings: Sub-communities can be formed around current affairs that are irrelevant to football, perhaps due to opportunistic attempts of using the large networks and massive attention during football matches to disseminate information. Furthermore, the popularity of tweets featuring different topics depends on the types of influencers involved. Practical implications: The methods can help football clubs develop a deeper understanding of their online social communities. The findings can also inform football clubs on how to optimise their communication strategies by using various influencers. Originality/value: Compared to previous research, the authors discovered a wide range of influencers and denser networks characterised by a smaller number of large clusters.

Graphs are typically employed to represent user interactions, but several algorithms become impractical for analyzing large graphs. Hence, it can be useful to analyze a small sub-graph instead in a practice known as graph sampling. However, if the graph is unobtainable, for example, due to privacy limitations, graph sampling is impossible. We introduce an innovative algorithm for representing a large unobtainable graph of user relationships such as Facebook friendships, using a streaming graph of user activity that can include, for example, wall posts on Facebook. We applied different methods of the proposed algorithm to two large datasets. The results show that averages and distribution statistics of nodes in a large, unobtainable relationship graph are well represented by a graph of about 20% of the size of the unobtainable graph. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to identify influencers in an unobtainable graph by analyzing a representative graph. We find that 63% to 76% of identified influencers in the representative graph act as influencers in the unobtainable graph, suggesting that the developed algorithm can effectively capture properties of the unobtainable graph. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

This trend is becoming more acute, especially among the younger sections of the population who are therefore more attractive to advertisers as consumers. This change in the media landscape requires the implementation of new communication and advertising strategies by advertisers. The rise of the so-called influencers has been a real novelty when it comes to publicizing and increasing the desire to consume brands and products from different sectors. Methodology: To carry out our study, we used a multi-method methodology that mainly consists of the use of qualitative and quantitative scientific research to analyze these communication strategies and their commercial possibilities in the current digital context. Results: This research aims to analyze the role of so-called virtual influencers, avatars created by artificial intelligence and augmented reality techniques, that allow the traditional influencer´s communication and advertising possibilities to be combined with the absolute control of his activity and “life” on the networks. Discussion: Influencers have become the opinion leaders of the 21st century and commercial brands are betting on them to deliver their messages.

Through the use of hashtags, conference information can be gathered, referenced, disseminated, and discussed in 1 electronic location by attendees and nonattendees from remote locations. The aim of this study is to analyze the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress (ACSCC) Twitter hashtag activities and evaluate its impact on meeting participation and engagement for the last 5 annual meetings. Methods: Twitter hashtags #ACSCC15, #ACSCC16, #ACSCC17, #ACSCC18, and #ACSCC19 were studied to determine tweets, retweets, users, and impressions. Data regarding top influencers and the most tweeted links were analyzed. Symplur Signals, a software that specializes in hashtags, was utilized for the analyses. Results: Between 2015 and 2017, there was a consistent increase in tweets from 12 800 to 18 300 to 24 700, respectively. However, in 2018 and 2019, tweets dropped significantly to 19 700 and 19 300, respectively (P <.05). Additionally, impressions dropped significantly by 24 million impressions from 2017 to 2019 (115.1M to 91.1M, P <.05) despite the growth of users from 2700 in 2015 to 4100 in 2016 and ~6500 in 2017-2019.

Posts' impact was measured with the nominal and relative (%followers) number of likes and retweets. A sentiment analysis was conducted.We have identified 17,331 COVID-19-related tweets posted by 338 accounts in >4 months since the virus began to spread. The largest number of likes was received by tweets of celebrities (median nominal, relative likes; 14,918, 0.036 percent), politicians (259, 0.174 percent), and health agencies (231, 0.007 percent). Most retweeted messages were also posted by celebrities (2,366, 0.005 percent), health agencies (130, 0.004 percent), and politicians (55, 0.041 percent). Retweets and likes peaked in March 2020, and the overall sentiment of the tweets was growing steadily.

Cyberbullying by higher education employees is a neglected phenomenon; despite the dangers it poses to academic free speech as well as other negative outcomes. In the absence of an adequate definition for Online Academic Bullying (OAB) as a surfacing threat, its’ targets cannot readily gauge its severity or confidently report that they are victims. Nor do their attackers have a reference point for understanding and, perhaps, correcting their own incivility. To remedy this, we propose an analytical framework grounded in Routine Activity Theory (RAT) that can serve as an appropriate reporting instrument. The OABRAT framework is illustrated with an Emeritus Professor's case and the varied examples of cyber harassment that he experienced. This scientific influencer was relentlessly attacked on social media platforms by varied academics for expressing contrarian, but evidence-based, opinions. Spotlighting OAB's distinctive attacks should raise awareness amongst researchers and institutional policy makers. The reporting instrument may further assist with identifying and confronting this threat. This article also flags ethical concerns related to dissident scholars’ usage of online platforms for informal, public debates. Such scholars may face an asymmetrical challenge in confronting cyber harassment from hypercritical academics and cybermobs on poorly moderated platforms. Universities should therefor consider appropriate countermeasures to protect both the public and their employees against victimisation by academic cyberbullies. © 2021Activity theory, Cyberbullying, Higher education, Peer victimisation © 2021"

Numerical simulations are performed to map the domain of the ordered regime on various network topologies.

This paper explores the mechanisms for improving participant and public engagement with citizen science results, using the New Zealand Garden Bird Survey (NZGBS) as a case study. It investigates how citizen science can apply democratic processes to be more responsive, while drawing on insights from behaviour change frameworks to facilitate a purposeful design. By inviting NZGBS participants to select, inform and peer review the design and promotion of new resources, our goal was to embed their values, opinions and perspectives into the developments. This not only empowered 15,844 respondents to contribute directly to the citizen science initiative's governance over 6 years, but also made it more engaging and useful to them and the wider public. New resources were designed to create a sense of collective action, making them attractive, easy to understand and promote on multiple media channels, aiming to reach a wider range of audiences. By diversifying and refining our communication strategy, we successfully enhanced the level and nature of engagement with the resources. The number and diversity of NZGBS participants also increased to involve people from a wider range of backgrounds and roles, ethnicities and ages. By applying a democratic process, we demonstrate how citizen scientist perspectives were elevated, to offset and mitigate the influence of institutional powers, which can dominate and shape engagement processes. We also highlight the value of behaviour change frameworks for understanding how choice architecture, social networks and key influencers, and their complex interactions can create the enabling environment required for engagement.

Social media, with their instantaneous and widespread usage, have been exploited by ‘anonymous’ political influencers who fabricate and inundate internet community with unverified and false information. Using van Leeuwen’s Discourse Legitimation approach and insights from Discourse Analysis, this study analyses 120 purposively sampled fake news posts on Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter, shared during the 2019 general elections in Nigeria. WhatsApp allows for the easy and fast sharing of fake news as it pulled the largest occurrence of legitimation strategies, followed by Facebook. Authorisation is the highest occurring legitimation strategy at 46.6% frequency; this is followed by Moralisation which has 27% and Rationalisation at 26.4%; while Mythopoesis did not feature at all in the sampled data, leaving it at 0%. In particular, expert and role model authority are most often deployed to validate fake news such as the demise and cloning of President Buhari, ruling party’s plan to rig and destabilise the 2019 election, massive corruption in the current administration and imminent ethnic violence. The study argues that these strategies are viable persuasive tools owing to their use of discourse markers like make-believe images, emotive language, appeal to emotions, rational conclusions, hateful comments, verbal indictment and coercive verbs. © The Author(s) 2020."

One of the significant areas of opportunity in digital marketing is influencer marketing, but identifying these influencers from big data sets is a continual challenge. This research illustrates how one type of influencer, the market maven, can be identified using big data. Using a mixed-method combination of both self-report survey data and publicly accessible big data, we gathered 556,150 tweets from 370 active Twitter users. We then proposed and tested a range of social-media-based metrics to identify market mavens. Findings show that market mavens (when compared to non-mavens) have more followers, post more often, have less readable posts, use more uppercase letters, use less distinct words, and use hashtags more often. These metrics are openly available from public Twitter accounts and could integrate into a broad-scale decision support system for marketing and information systems managers.

With the vast development of information technologies in the era of the internet-of-things, occupant sensing and data acquisition are not limited to a single node or traditional approaches. The prevalence of social networks provides a myriad of publically available social media data that might contain occupancy information in the space for a given time. In this paper, we explore two approaches to extract the typical occupancy schedules for the input to the building energy simulation based on the data from social networks. The first approach uses text classification algorithms to identify whether people are present in the space where they are posting on social media. On top of that, the typical building occupancy schedules are extracted with assumed people counting rules. The second approach utilizes the processed Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking data provided by social networking service companies such as Facebook and Google Maps. Web scraping techniques are used to obtain and post-process the raw data to extract the typical building occupancy schedules. The results show that the extracted building occupancy schedules from different data sources (Twitter, Facebook, and Google Maps) share a similar trend but are slightly distinct from each other and hence may require further validation and corrections. To further demonstrate the application of the extracted Typical Occupancy Schedules from Social Media (TOSSM), data-driven models for predicting hourly energy usage prediction of a university museum are developed with the integration of TOSSM. The results indicate that the incorporation of TOSSM could improve the hourly energy usage prediction accuracy to a small extent regarding the four adopted evaluation metrics for this museum building. © 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

We show how the increasing professionalization of the influencer steers their relationship with their audience, the advertisers they work with, and the platform Instagram. We argue that, for the Instagram influencer to be perceived as successful, they need to negotiate a tension: they need to appear authentic, yet also approach their followers in a strategic way to remain appealing to advertisers. Although Instagram influencers are seen as more trustworthy than traditional forms of advertising, this tension ultimately leads to a standardization of the content shared by influencers. © The Author(s) 2020."

Two experiments employing different manipulations (i.e., pictures taken by others and selfies) were performed to examine the effects of conspicuously displaying male influencers' muscles on consumers' intentions to purchase endorsed products. In Experiment 1, we found that conspicuous (vs. inconspicuous) display of muscles reduced perceived trustworthiness among women, leading to lower purchase intentions around a gender-neutral product. Experiment 2 corroborated this finding and further demonstrated that the effects of a muscular body were not domain-specific. Both experiments presented evidence opposing the common belief that conspicuously displaying one's muscles is appealing: female consumers exhibited less trust toward the muscle-flaunting male influencer, resulting in lower intentions to purchase endorsed products. Results contribute to a better understanding of the application of evolutionary theory and signaling theory in digital marketing and advance our knowledge of gender differences in a social media consumption context.

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted the netnography approach to investigate churn behavior by utilizing online user-generated content in qualified social media communities. Findings: The investigation revealed that “data speed issue”, “ineffective relationship building”, “service area coverage issues” and “billing issues” are some of the most important attributes that influence a consumers' decision to churn. Further, the churn consequence influencers model summarizes the attributes that contribute to overall dissatisfaction and finally results in churn behavior. The study found out the application of the netnography approach in a quantitatively dominant research area and stands out with its insights from a rich qualitative data. Practical implications: Proper clarification of customer expectations and pain points can help reduce customer churn. The study will serve as the basis for developing future churn prediction models that will contribute to the informed decision-making process.

This framework centers on examining how local food consumption value (TLFCV), local food experiential value (TLFEV) and social media influencers (SMIs) impact upon tourists’ attitudes toward local food (ATLF) and food destination image (FDI). The impact of ATLF and FDI on tourists’ BIs is also examined. Design/methodology/approach: PLS-SEM was used to test the hypothesized relationships using survey responses from 379 tourists visiting Rasht, Iran. Findings: The results demonstrate that TLFCV, TLFEV and SMIs can be used to populate a theoretical framework for predicting and understanding the factors influencing tourists’ ATLF and FDI. Specifically, positive ATLF and FDI stimulated positive BIs (e.g., intending to recommend Iranian food to others and intending to revisit Iran in future for culinary tourism purposes). Practical implications: The findings provide managers and practitioners within the culinary tourism industry with suggestions for how best to strategically market their offerings to increase inbound food tourism. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to empirically evaluate the drivers of food tourists' BIs, presenting a newly developed model for deployment in future research.

Everything comes wrapped in a story, and the means employed to weave the narrative thread are just as important as the story itself. In this context, there is a need to understand the role storytelling plays in contemporary society, which has changed drastically in recent decades. Modern global society is no longer exclusively dominated by the time-tested narrative media such as literature or films because new media such as videogames or social platforms have changed the way we understand, create, and replicate stories. The Handbook of Research on Contemporary Storytelling Methods Across New Media and Disciplines is a comprehensive reference book that provides the relevant theoretical framework that concerns storytelling in modern society, as well as the newest and most varied analyses and case studies in the field. The chapters of this extensive volume follow the construction and interpretation of stories across a plethora of contemporary media and disciplines. By bringing together radical forms of storytelling in traditional disciplines and methods of telling stories across newer media, this book intersects themes that include interactive storytelling and narrative theory across advertisements, social media, and knowledge-sharing platforms, among others. It is targeted towards professionals, researchers, and students working or studying in the fields of narratology, literature, media studies, marketing and communication, anthropology, religion, or film studies. Moreover, for interested executives and entrepreneurs or prospective influencers, the chapters dedicated to marketing and social media may also provide insights into both the theoretical and the practical aspects of harnessing the power of storytelling in order to create a cohesive and impactful online image. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Online influencers, or ‘everyday people who are influential within their online social networks’, are viewed as trusted voices who are often making similar life decisions as their followers. Therefore, their experiences with and perspectives on health issues can be persuasive. Methods: We collaborated with a formal network of online influencers to interview, using a semi-structured interview guide, vaccine hesitant influencer mothers about their views on vaccination; their process for developing health-related social media content; their motivation to promote anti-vaccine messages; and their opinions on current vaccination messaging. Prescreening ensured a diverse sample by race/ethnicity, age, education, number of children, and geographic residence. Interviews occurred by telephone, were audio recorded, and transcribed. Themes were generated independently by two coders using a deductive coding approach. Results: We interviewed 15 online influencer mothers from across the U.S. (average age 39 years old; all married; 13 Caucasian, 1 African American, 1 Hispanic). In some capacity, 5 of the 15 wrote about vaccination on their blog. Those who chose not to post anti-vaccine content did so for fear of alienating followers or having their platform be the site of combative discourse among readers. When researching their social media posts, the influencers did not trust mainstream sources of health information and relied on alternative sources and search engines. Implications: This exploratory study interviewed influential mothers who have the ability to spread anti-vaccine messages on social media. While most do not contribute to the anti-vaccine sentiment, understanding the motivation and practices of those that do assists the public health community in better understanding the online vaccination communication environment, leading to more effective messages to counterbalance anti-vaccine content on social media. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

In order for information to spread to many users, it is important to know how the information diffusion model or the flow of information is and who is the influencer on social media. In this paper, the Information Diffusion Model in social media was developed using the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC). The tweet-retweet activity of social media users such as on Twitter can be seen as the CTMC model, because it fulfills the nature of Markov, i.e. retweets from subsequent users depend only on the current user's retweet and do not depend on the retweet history of previous users. Users engaged in retweet tweets are state of CTMC. By using the tweet-retweet network simulation data including 10 users and 4 topics, the influencer rankings were obtained. An influencer rating is determined not only by the number of retweets, but also by the time it takes to get those retweets. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved."

Studies have recently begun investigating how influencers affect consumer behaviour. Despite the increasing interest, the purpose of this study is to examine influencers’ evaluation impact on consumer behaviour are scarce. Design/methodology/approach: An online study undertook research to gain further understanding. Specifically, the study examines the following: firstly, the impact of consumers’ perceived influencer credibility (IC), using the source credibility model in respect of purchase intention, attitude towards advertising and product; secondly, the impact of the organizational behaviour concept psychological ownership (PO) on consumer behaviour by showing that the concept has significant positive effects on attitude towards the product and purchase intention like in prior research; thirdly, the perceived connection and relationship between the influencer and consumer to understand the relations. Findings: The results show that perceived IC serves as a significant criterion, determining purchase intention, attitude towards advertising and product, while contributing an instrument for transferring convincing messages, which increase the perceived connection to the influencer and the PO feeling for a product and, thus, influence consumer behaviour positively. Originality/value: Theories on source credibility and a connection to the PO concept allowed to develop a framework to assess the importance of IC and its influence on consumers’ perception of the products that influencers advertise to better understand the interactions in the influencer marketing context. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This paper investigated the effects of the number and types of social actors in the contents of Instagram on users' reactions. To identify this, we collected the users' comments from the contents of the virtual influencers' accounts on Instagram and conducted sentiment analysis. The results showed that users tend to use more social words and 3rd-person pronouns in contents with multiple social actors including the virtual influencer than in contents with a virtual influencer. Moreover, when a virtual influencer is presented in the contents of social media with humans, users tend to use more positive words and anxious words than in the contents without humans.

In particular, as consumers’ media use and consumption behavior change around digital media, social media plays a very important role in consumers’ lives. From this perspective, influencers who influence not only consumers’ consumption behavior, but also decision-making and opinion formation based on social media are attracting attention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop items to measure an influencer’s reputation as a new source of information in the SNS environment; no previous researchers have pre-sented generalized measurement items for an influencer’s reputation. We intended to identify what dimensions and items in the existing literature could effectively measure a social media influencer’s reputation and to verify each item’s relevance as a measure of a social media influencer’s reputation. Based on in-depth interviews with 30 experts and empirical findings from 557 adults, this study identified dimensions that impact on a consumer’s perception of a social media influencer and developed a scale. The results showed that the social media Influencer’s Reputation scale comprises four distinctive dimensions: Communication skills, influence, authenticity, and expertise. Additionally, the reliability and validity of the scale were assessed, using exploratory and confirmatory analyses and construct validity. The findings confirmed that the social media influencer’s reputation scale measurement items, in this study, can be used as a consistent measurement tool for each dimension. It is also important to develop value in favor of the marketing strategy by increasing value through the influencer’s reputation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

An increasing number of social media users post, retweet, share, interpret, and set agendas on North Korea. The accessibility of international users and North Korea’s publicity purposes make social media a venue for expression, news diversity, and framing about the nation. This study examined the sentiment of Twitter posts on North Korea from a framing perspective and the relationship between network strengths and sentiment from a social network perspective. Data were collected using two tools: Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.6 for preliminary analysis and NodeXL for main analysis. A total of 11,957 tweets, 10,000 of which were collected using Python and 1,957 tweets using NodeXL, about North Korea between June 20-21, 2020 were collected. Results demonstrated that there was more negative sentiment than positive sentiment about North Korea in the sampled Twitter posts. Some users belonging to small network sizes reached out to others on Twitter to build networks and spread positive information about North Korea. Influential users tended to be impartial to sentiment about North Korea, while some Twitter users with a small network exhibited high percentages of positive words about North Korea. Overall, marginalized populations with network bonding were more likely to express positive sentiment about North Korea than were influencers at the center of networks. © 2021 This is an Open Access paper distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Due to enforcement issues and the paucity of damages awarded to individual and companies, there is a significant lack of literature on this field of law. As a consequence, this study, which compares the U.S. and Germany while also proposing how, exactly, the law needs to change, is unique. Hardly any other area of law is home to this much ambiguity that affects such a large number of people, and as a result, the present legal situation cannot be allowed to continue. Neither advertisers, influencers, nor social media platforms know what, and in particular, how, they are supposed to disclose their connections to companies, nor do social media users know what they can expect from posts they see on the internet. After an overview of the entire field, a comparison between the German system and the U.S. system, with its larger market, reveals that American law suffers from similar gaps as German law. The most pressing issues are that, in Germany, it is not clear when disclosure needs to be made, while the extent of a disclosure needs to be clarified in both systems. A proposal to balance the freedom of influencers with the risk of misleading social media users is put forward, in a form that would enable it to be added to existing legislation. In both systems, social media platforms would have to provide a visual tool, like a frame or button, which would have to be used by influencers. This would enable social media users to easily distinguish between sponsored content and content that has no connection to an advertiser while scrolling through posts and without having to look at the content of the post itself. In Germany, a definition would be amended to trigger the disclosure obligation only if the post represents a direct commercial benefit for the influencer, such as a paid relationship or the initiation of a contract © 2021, Chicago-Kent Journal of Intellectual Property.

It is crucial to explore factors that affect the follower’s purchase intention of the products endorsed by social media influencers. Recently, micro-influencers have gained recognition for their authenticity and relatability when compared with their established counterparts, such as macro- or mega-influencers. Increasing organizations also see the value micro-influencers can bring to their brands via more interaction with their target customers. Based on the parasocial interaction theory, we propose that the perceived credibility and transparency of micro-influencers enhance followers’ purchase intention through the mediation of parasocial interaction. Parasocial interaction is a kind of psychological relationship in which followers consider influencers as their friends, regardless of their limited interactions with those influencers. Our findings indicate that parasocial interaction between micro-influencers and their followers positively impacts purchase intentions of recommended products. It is also found that perceived micro-influencer credibility and transparency positively affect followers’ parasocial interaction with micro-influencers.

A social network site that is of specific importance to many global marketers, especially those targeting the millennial generation, is Instagram. A popular marketing strategy used on Instagram is that of influential marketing where brands use influencers to promote their products and brands. Despite the popularity of influential marketing, little research is available on the use of influential marketing in an Instagram context. This study was therefore conceptualised and executed to investigate the influence of selected system-generated cues and user-generated content on the perceived credibility of an influencer as brand endorser and thus source to consumers on Instagram. Both qualitative and quantitative research were conducted. In the qualitative phase, two focus group discussions confirmed the variables that were measured in quantitative research which consisted of a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial experiment. A non-probability convenience sampling technique realised a sample of 311 millennial female respondents (18–25) across 8 experimental groups. The results indicated that advertising disclosure significantly influenced overall perceived source (influencer) credibility, trustworthiness and homophily, while non-disclosure was perceived more positively by respondents than advertising disclosure. The findings of the study make a valuable contribution to a field in marketing that is growing in popularity and it is believed that insights gained can be used rewardingly by academic scholars and strategic marketers who have an interest in using Instagram as a marketing tool. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This survey research intends to understand how people from a fourth-class municipality of Cavite made their decision to be vaccinated in spite of false information circulating within family, friends, and neighbors. Methods. The study employed survey research and gathered data using voluntary sampling from a pool of citizens with an appointment schedule in the vaccination site located in Magallanes, Cavite. Results. The pandemic saw a rise in the spread of information disorders. The proliferation of fake news and misinformation affect our lives as they disrupt relationships with family members and friends. Trust is being questioned as people believe in contrasting medical opinions. The overload of information sharing is a challenge for individuals to evaluate news sources coming from multiple platforms. As the status of inoculation in the Philippines is ongoing, citizens who want protection took time to get vaccinated. The impact of traditional and social media continues to be powerful influencers in information dissemination. As we deal with overabundance of information, librarians have an emerging role to play.

Indeed, as part of the digital technologies that connect consumers to the market, the relationship between marketing technologies and the agri-food industry needs a comprehensive survey of the state-of-art work, especially with the recent advancement of social media, big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing that facilitates the demand and experiences of food. To identify the scope, exemplar work, and emerging research themes, the scoping review has analyzed 619 articles, screened from the Web of Science database. The findings reveal that the influence of social networking websites and media has undergone intense scrutiny for unhealthy food intake, less so for pro-environment behavior and attitudes.

Structure of the model includes population, economy, education system, social media and state administration. The economy and education system form the social environment for the agent. The media provide information content that influences norms and values of the agents. State administration regulates this content and filter out undesirable norms and values. To maintain interactions of agents with their environment we propose the architecture that includes biological and social characteristics, socio-economic and political interests, norms end estimates. We divide agents into four clusters with different persuasion power and persuasion acceptance to the influence: Foxes (professional participants in socio-political processes), Wolves (ideological participants); Dogs (foundation of social movements with high persuasion acceptance) and Rabbits (neutral part of the population). We present two algorithms that simulate agents' interactions and changes in their opinions: one-way influence of one agent on a number of others and two-way interaction in a pair of familiar agents. In the first algorithm, the agents get exposure to the influencers on Internet platforms. In the second algorithm agents contact with each other if they live in one household, study in educational institution and work in the same organization. In order to fill the model with the real-world data we use information presented on the website of the Federal State Statistics Service, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education and the portal of the budgetary system of the Russian Federation.

Social media has also allowed gendered disinformation to be used in targeted harassment campaigns that seek to intimidate and shame women, reducing their public visibility through psychological violence. Despite this, very few studies on social media involving the Arabic language have explored in detail this phenomenon in the Persian Gulf, despite numerous examples of harassment against women public figures. Since 2017, women journalists critical of regional governments have been subjected to increased attacks online, but none as intense as the attack on Al Jazeera anchor Ghada Oueiss in June 2020. Through keyword analysis, network analysis, and open-source intelligence techniques (OSINT), this paper highlights the intensity and scale of one such attack, identifying the increasing role of malinformation and disinformation in attempting to silence journalists. Such documentation can be useful in demonstrating the volume, velocity, and discursive nature of the attacks threatening women's visibility online. This research also accounts for a potential mechanism of such attacks, which follow a playbook of: 1) leaking information through anonymous accounts, 2) co-opted or loyalist influencers amplifying the attacks, and 3) uncritical local media jumping on the attacks (breakout). From a transformative perspective, it is increasingly important that such attacks are documented, exposed, and analysed to provide evidentiary claims of such abuse. It also highlights the issues of such abuse in authoritarian regimes, who clamp down on online debate, except appear not to do so when the messaging reflects state propaganda. © 2021 Marc Owen Jones, published by De Gruyter."

This is a boon to self-expression and communication but has allowed for misinformation to flourish as well. It may be difficult to differentiate facts from misleading opinions. Automatic fact-checking has the potential to reduce the spread of misinformation while browsing. Multiple potential approaches to implementing fact-checking software have been explored. One approach is to detect the information's origin and evaluate if it is a valid primary source. Most existing methods to model the spread of information online require extensive computational resources and time to train a deep-learning algorithm, as well as a high-level representation of the propagation of the content. In addition, these methods are mainly used to classify and verify the information itself rather than the information's provenance. The Hawkes process makes it possible to evaluate and model information spread tendencies and map out the source of the information by comparing the intensity of shared posts over time. 1000 posts of 3 blog pages on Reddit were scraped from the Internet to test if the modified Hawkes process can detect which page is influenced by which. The Hawkes process was able to distinguish the influenced, the influencer and the control blog page. Therefore, the Hawkes process may be used to identify the primary sources of information. Future research may need to compare the accuracy and precision of this process compared to other methods. © 2021 IEEE."

The current study explores patterns of change in these negative perceptions, and their associated emotional outcomes, in an online social context. Undergraduate students (N = 291) browsed the profiles of eight Instagram influencers and completed a measure of social comparison after viewing each profile, yielding multiple ratings of their own perceived social rank. Participants completed measures of affect and state self-esteem before and after the profile browsing task. Higher social anxiety predicted lower, and greater declines in, social rank self-perceptions during browsing. Higher social anxiety also predicted greater decreases in positive affect, increases in negative affect, and decreases in state self-esteem from the beginning to the end of the browsing task. Low baseline rank perceptions contributed to change in all three emotional variables. Decreases in rank perceptions contributed further to decreases in positive affect and appearance-related self-esteem. This study elaborates on cognitive-evolutionary theory, suggesting that the inferiority selfperceptions of socially anxious individuals translate to online social contexts, may be strengthened with increased exposure to such contexts, and may have a detrimental emotional impact. © 2021.

We conduct a social media study of public opinion toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement based on 46,058 Twitter users across 30 states in USA ranging from March 18, 2021 to April 11, 2021. To facilitate fine-grained analyses, the demographic information of the Twitter users, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, social capital, political affiliation, geolocation, family, income, and religious status, is either retrieved from the user profiles or inferred using classifiers. We find that the movement attracts more participation from women, younger adults, Asian, and Black communities. It is noteworthy that most of them are also active in other online movements related to racial or social issues, such as #BlackLivesMatter or #SayHerName; 51.56&#x0025; of the Twitter users show direct support, 18.38&#x0025; are news about anti-Asian hate crimes, and 5.43&#x0025; show a negative attitude toward the movement. By conducting logistic regression, we find that the public opinion varies across user characteristics. Furthermore, among the states with most racial bias-motivated hate crimes, the negative attitude toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement is the weakest. The majority of the top influencers are Asian-American reporters, journalists, or politicians. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to understand public opinion toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement.

SMIs constitute significant contributors to destination image, yet tourism scholars have not fully explored their persuasive power in framing destinations and affecting potential travellers. This article explores how Iran is framed as a travel destination by SMIs on YouTube by utilizing visual framing theory. As a country subject to both unfavourable framing by Western mainstream media and positive images by SMIs and YouTubers, Iran represents an interesting case study as a destination produced in the cyberworld with multiple and contrasting images and representations. Methodologically, the study integrates netnography and narrative analysis to examine the content of ten travel videos produced by international SMIs. The analysis and interpretation of the visual material unveil the multiple ways of framing Iran by SMIs, which tend to humanize Iran and Iranians, emphasize the country's culture and history, and attribute the misconceptions and fear about Iran to the current global and local political climate. Theoretically, this study advances our understanding of destination image through visual framing theory, which has rarely been applied to explore travel videos. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

To remain competitive, however, influencers depend on how they convey authenticity, which largely relies on the key visual elements of the photographs they post in social media. The purpose of this study is to explore the visual elements of photography used by social media influencers and to compare the main photography trends in digital media. Specifically, it aims to shed light on how new photography trends such as urban background style and fashion models with large body sizes produce effects on consumers. To accomplish this objective, an online experimental setting was prepared to compare the effect of an urban versus a solid background and a fashion model with a large versus a thin body size on perceived authenticity and purchase intent. The research finds that urban background and large body size of model significantly increase digital engagement. These results are in line with the research hypotheses that allude to the perception of authenticity as the key construct behind the effects on digital engagement. The inquiry also evaluates the interaction effect of the urban background and large body size of the model on perceived authenticity. In doing so, the present research examines the mediation role of perceived authenticity on the intention to buy. The results contribute to update theory about the influencers’ role on digital engagement and photography trends in social media. It also shows that perceived authenticity exerts a mediating role between visual elements on purchase intentions © 2021. Communication Today.All Rights Reserved"

This paper explores the relationship between influencers’ characteristics (i.e., centrality and trustworthiness), the efficacy of social media posting (i.e., empathy and immersion), and consumers’ product attitude. The study further reveals a critical role of sponsorship disclosure in this mechanism. Based on the data from social media users, our findings demonstrated that influencers’ centrality and trustworthiness were positively related to consumers’ empathic response and immersion toward the social media posting. Consumers’ empathy and immersion strongly mediate the link between influencers’ characteristics and consumers’ attitudes toward the product. Notably, the current study also indicated the moderating role of sponsorship activities and found different effects of centrality and trustworthiness with an apparent sponsorship disclosure.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine how young Instagram users (e.g., generation Z and millennials) establish consumer-brand relationships (i.e., parasocial interaction, related closeness) through perceived values toward an Instagram ad (i.e., similarity/likability, perceived interactivity, exposure/openness), especially between familiar versus unfamiliar models. Through the lens of Parasocial Interaction Theory, relationship strength is differentiated depending on types of content, thus this study scrutinizes the effects of the relationship between consumers and familiarity of models on positive relationship building and the variables associated with and influence that relationship. An online survey of 274 Instagram users was conducted via Amazon Mturk. Data analyses were conducted, using SPSS 25.0 and a multigroup structural equation modeling was utilized, using AMOS 22.0, to test the suggested relationships. The study findings provide insights to marketers on how to practice better social media marketing strategies by collaborating with influencers/celebrities and exhibit effective and relevant marketing campaigns to targeted audiences. Our study results confirmed likeability as one of the strongest predictors for parasocial interaction which is in line with the findings from previous studies regarding Parasocial Interaction Theory. Though openness was addressed and confirmed as one of critical factors that lead consumers’ PSI, our finding demonstrates that importance of openness matters for only familiar models.

This article focuses on two (in)famous Influencers in the scandal: fashion stylist Han Haeyoun and mukbang-YouTuber tzuyang. By situating reactions around the scandal within broader Influencer ecologies and Korean cultures, we map out tensions between various actors, and the subsequent embroilments with online hate, call-out cultures, and misogyny.

This study sets to describe how social media influences the buying intentions of Wearable Devices (WD). In doing so, constructs from Information Acceptance Model (IACM) had been compared to the resulting themes from 9 one-on-one interview responses and a relationship between social media and wearable devices was formed. Objectives: Primary objectives were to determine the relationship between social media and; (i) WD sales, (ii) WD features and application information (iii) ongoing interactions on WD’s. Secondary objectives were to determine (i) if the availability of a WD affected the volume of social media interactions and (ii) if the value associated with a WD was related to the social media posts of that device. Design, Methodology, and Approach: This study took a qualitative approach to research and used phenomenology as a stance of exploring social media’s influence on purchase intentions towards the wearable device. A positivist philosophical standpoint was applied to deduce themes from the ICAM by touching on interpretivism elements in analyzing the data collected from semi-structured interviews. The data was then categorized into themes, refined into sub-themes and then assessed according to the research propositions as well as the ICAM frameworks constructs. Findings: Social media was viewed more of as an information outlet as opposed to a driver of purchase intention. From this, it was seen that word of mouth was the biggest driver in WD awareness. Information Quality, Attitudes towards information were the main influencers that social media has towards purchase intention from the ICAM model. This was evident in the construct scores which showed that there was a relationship between the adoption of social media information and purchase intention, that there is a relationship between the features of a WD and social media usage as well as showing that there is a relationship between the users’ perception of the type of social media platform and the WD presented on that platform.

The role of influencers has already been acknowledged by both academy and the companies, yet the literature in regard with this topic faces some limitations. At the same time, evidence shows that Instagram is the mostly used platform by influencers/opinion leaders in the fashion industry and influencers/opinion leaders are an important source of impact for their followers. The aim of this paper is to explore the role that influencers on Instagram play in the behavior of consumers. Its main objective is the identification of the impact that some antecedents (stimuli) have on the opinion leadership, as well as the impact that the latter has on the consequent (response) purchase intention of consumers, in the fashion sector in Albania. The research followed a quantitative approach, with a sample of 412 followers of a fashion focused Instagram account (of a non-traditional celebrity), that answered an online questionnaire. The results of the research suggest that opinion leadership impacts the consumer behavioral intentions.

In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of Twitter posts about COVID-19 during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify influential sources of COVID-19 information and understand the characteristics of these sources. We identified influential accounts based on an information diffusion network representing the interactions of Twitter users who discussed COVID-19 in the United States over a 24-h period. The network analysis revealed 11 influential accounts that we categorized as: 1) political authorities (elected government officials), 2) news organizations, and 3) personal accounts. Our findings showed that while verified accounts with a large following tended to be the most influential users, smaller personal accounts also emerged as influencers. Our analysis revealed that other users often interacted with influential accounts in response to news about COVID-19 cases and strongly contested political arguments received the most interactions overall.

For an advertisement to reach a large number of audience, business owners usually relay on social media influencers to deliver advertisements messages. However, there are a large number of influencers and it is critical step for business owners to select influencers to be hired. One important measure that has been used to assist the process of selecting an influencer is the influencer engagement rate. Engagement rate measure aims to evaluate how well an influencer can attract potential customers. The current engagement rate measures depend on a simple information such as number of followers, posts, or comments on an influencer account. In this paper we propose a more sophisticated engagement rate measure based on a carful analysis of potential customers reaction to an influencer advertisements posts. The new measure works only on advertisements posts. Also, it take into account the polarity of the comments on these posts, not only their count. To efficiently compute the new engagement rate measure over large size of data, we propose machine learning (ML) approaches to generate necessarily information to compute the new engagement rate measure. We use ML approaches, in particular classifications, in two stages. First, we use classification to efficiently classify a post to an advertisement and none advertisement post. Next, we use ML based sentiments analysis approach to determine the polarity of the comments on an advertisement post. The new measure could be used to measure users engagement to any post and in a wide range of social media platforms. We tested the new engagement rate measure using Instagram influencer accounts, in specific Instafamous accounts. Compared to the current measures, our results show that this new ML based engagement rate measure suggests significantly different ranked list of potential influencers.

We argue that Bines’ pedagogical expertise is made possible through her seemingly contradictory media practices and messages, whereby she cultivates an ‘authentic’ personal experience for her followers. We frame these productive tensions in her social media practices as a form of ‘influencer pedagogy’–the indirect, mediated processes of education produced through relatable interactions between influencers and their followers on social media platforms.

Method: Based on a sample of 660 respondents, Multiple Linear Regression and the Moderation Test by Hayes Macro PROCESS were performed. Originality/Relevance: Although the constructs have already been studied from other perspectives, especially the SC and the PR, they have not been investigated together, nor did they deal with the purchase of hotel services. In addition, the research emphasizes the conceptual solidification of the USM. Results: The results indicate that influencers are more persuasive when assessed as reliable and physically attractive sources. The same occurs when there is a unilateral relationship of affection between endorser and spectator. However, the more frequent use of social media mitigates and negates these inferences. Theoretical/methodological contributions: It is believed that attractiveness may not be a dimension of the credibility of the source when it comes to digital influencers. In addition, in an online communication context, the feeling of affinity of the parasocial relationship may not be enough to make endorsers persuasive. Finally, it presents discussions adjacent to the use of social media that contribute to its theoretical maturity. Management contributions: The main managerial revelation of this study is the finding that individuals with greater use of social media may appear more skeptical, critical and indifferent about the digital influencers' announcements. © The Author(s), 2021."

Researchers used a case study method to test whether Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) should be expanded to include collaborative brand attack (CBA) as a crisis type. Researchers used traditional and extended SCCT to analyze MLB’s crisis response to determine which version fit best. Data were triangulated from sports news sources, MLB’s official statement and Twitter account, and social media influencer and stakeholder posts. Researchers asked which SCCT response MLB used and whether it was effective with stakeholders. Because of poor history, MLB’s accidental crisis response mismatched the level of stakeholder attribution of responsibility. Another question examined the role of social media. Major League Baseball underestimated the role of social media and SM influencers and, by underutilizing its Twitter feed, left stakeholders to attribute greater responsibility to MLB. Two final questions asked whether SCCT should be updated to include the CBA crisis type and whether it applied in this case. The results indicate the negative consequences of crisis/response mismatch and indicate that CBA should be incorporated into SCCT to address social media influence.

In our model, each seller sends a message and buyers search for a good match in terms of hidden differentiators. Since the meaning of a message is determined endogenously, multiple steady state equilibria exist. A maximal equilibrium displays assortative matching and its messaging strategies maximize the flow of surplus value. We show that it exists if the matching rate is high enough. This analysis reveals differences associated with newer media. For example, video can display information in such detail that a buyer may not need to inspect the house. The real time interactivity of social media also makes better messaging possible, if not necessarily consistent with an equilibrium. The goal of many social media messages is to “go viral” and that goal requires the participation of influencers, whose motives need to be considered more carefully. We offer a number of empirical predictions, conjectures and interesting special cases. We show that if the set of possible messages is a continuum then perfect messages are possible and selling prices would adapt in a way that minimizes time on market. In a maximal equilibrium, the messaging strategy used by a given type of seller need not vary across segments if the differences between segments are observable. Since so many people think that many property descriptions are colorful exaggerations, our equilibrium model provides a context for discussing whether a message misleads. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

To preclude paracrises’ possible escalation into crises, organizations must evaluate paracrises' evolution statuses and make appropriate public responses. This research explores a paracrisis’ temporal evolution on social media and traditional news media and the roles of social media influencers (SMIs) who impacted the evolution. A multi-method, single-case study of the #DeleteUber paracrisis was conducted to analyze tweets and traditional news media coverage. It is found that despite intense attention from social media and traditional news media, #DeleteUber did not escalate into a full-blown crisis. In addition to social media accounts owned by traditional news media, individuals with limited follower sizes and digital-born media also gained influence by providing objective information and subjective interpretations with different stances. Compared to follower sizes, SMIs’ network structures may be more effective in explaining and predicting their content virality. As one of the few studies examining paracrisis evolution processes, this research is of practical implications to crisis managers addressing crisis risks emerging from and/or spreading on social media. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

Addressing the importance of message sources, this study aims to (1) compare audience reactions toward BLM content posted by brands and by influencers with brand sponsorship and (2) apply computational methods in influencer marketing to examine a large volume of social media texts qualitatively and quantitatively. A total of 32,702 comments on 110 Instagram posts on BLM were collected and analyzed through both human efforts and machine-learning algorithms. As a result, we found that black-influencer-created BLM attracted higher consumer engagement than posts by nonblack influencers and brands. Moreover, we generated seven different themes among which brands received the highest percentages of criticism, demands for more proactive actions, and purchase/boycott intentions. Influencers had more comments that reflected personal stories and emotion regarding BLM. Black influencers in particular received the highest percentage of praise and appreciation. Finally, comments on brands’ BLM posts embedded the highest proportion of negative sentiment, while those of black influencers’ posts were predominantly positive. Therefore, the comparisons of BLM sources elucidate the promising potential of influencers in communicating corporate social responsibility (CSR) messages of racial equality—a topic which engenders high relevance to every individual in our society. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising."

Such sociocultural currency is referred to as celebrity capital, which can be exchanged within the field of advertising through celebrity endorsements. Traditional celebrities acquire celebrity capital through institutional intermediaries such as sport, television, music, and movies. Research is needed to understand the unique process by which social media influencers (SMIs) acquire celebrity capital. We draw on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers to better understand how influencers acquire celebrity capital in a saturated media landscape. Extending previous work on celebrity capital and influencer advertising, this study conceptualizes a process which we term influencer celebrification. Influencer celebrification is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. Empirical findings identify three types of practices in the influencer celebrification process: generative practices; collaborative practices; and evaluative practices. This study identifies the role of advertising practitioners in the influencer celebrification process and offers implications for advertising theory and practice. © Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

However, their roles vis-à-vis the brands for which they advertise are changing. Far from being just simple promoters anymore they now take active part in both the product and communications development of firms. Yet in advertising research, a discussion of these new roles is absent. This article, therefore, seeks to categorize the roles influencers play in advertising collaborations by means of an empirical typology. In a netnographic study, we investigate the posts of 21 fashion influencers over a period of three years and find three main roles (spokesperson, cocreator, or co-owner) and eight subroles (for spokesperson: billboard, stylist, and ambassador; for cocreator: consultant and codesigner; for co-owner: sole proprietor, facilitator, and partner) that influencers take on in relation to brands. We contribute to theory on influencer marketing by conceptualizing influencer roles in advertising collaborations as well as categorizing these roles, thus allowing future researchers to use our typology as a conceptual foundation. Another contribution is the insight into how the dynamics of control over product and communication creation is evolving in influencer collaborations. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this article, I conceptualize a related and equally fundamental challenge for governance efforts: black box gaslighting. Black box gaslighting captures how platforms may leverage perceptions of their epistemic authority on their algorithms to undermine users’ confidence in what they know about algorithms and destabilize credible criticism. I explicate the concept of black box gaslighting through a case study of the ‘shadowbanning’ dispute within the Instagram influencer community, drawing on interviews with influencers (n = 17) and online discourse materials (e.g., social media posts, blog posts, videos, etc.). I argue that black box gaslighting presents a formidable deterrent for those seeking accountability: an epistemic contest over the legitimacy of critiques in which platforms hold the upper hand. At the same time, I suggest we must be mindful of the partial nature of platforms’ claim to ‘the truth,’ as well as the value of user understandings of algorithms. © 2021 The Author(s).

Primary data of the study were obtained via interviews with three netizens who are social media activists. They were: CPL, an influencer on Twitter with 135,000 followers; HSW, a media literacy activist; and HA, a blogger. They were selected based on their influence and activities on social media as well as accessibility. The study identified two major findings: first, the public (netizens) via conversations on Twitter wanted the government to implement a lockdown at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the government disregarded this call by utilising buzzers on social media. In practice, these buzzers cyberbullied netizens who requested for a lockdown. Consequently, netizens became polarised between those supporting and opposing a lockdown. This triggered a communication crisis as it led to loss of trust in the government as it did not meet public expectations. Secondly, the government’s use of buzzers to shoot down calls for a lockdown positioned them as an apparatus in the crisis communication throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in the emergence of “buzzer regime” and “buzzer state”. Buzzers are a part of the government’s informal apparatus that engage in activities on social media to repress netizens who hold opposing views against the government. © 2021, Taylor's University Lakeside Campus.

The present research establishes when and how the type of SMI based on the number of followers influences SMI advertising effectiveness. Specifically, the findings of four experimental studies show that micro-influencers (those who have 10,000 to 100,000 followers) are more persuasive than mega-influencers (those who have more than 1 million followers) because endorsements by micro-influencers (versus mega-influencers) bestow higher perceptions of authenticity on the endorsed brand, which “rubs off” from the perceptions regarding influencer authenticity. However, this differential effect of SMI type through influencer and brand authenticity occurs only when the endorsed product is perceived as hedonic (as opposed to utilitarian) consumption. From a theoretical perspective, these findings extend prior research on how endorsements from different SMI types vary in terms of their persuasiveness, shed light on the underlying mechanism, and identify consumption type as an important boundary condition. From a practical perspective, we offer managerial implications for enhancing the effectiveness of SMI advertising strategies by taking into consideration SMI types, consumption contexts, and message framing styles. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising."

Contemporary veganism has built a trident approach of outreach that emphasises health benefits, ethical concerns about animals, and environmentally sustainable consumption. With this growth, there have been opportunities for influencer-activists to profit from positioning themselves as movement leaders. This is often connected with thin, white, wealthy women and the wellness industry, but there is also a changing ‘meatless masculinity’ within vegan influencer-activist spaces. Hegemonic ideals of masculinity around physical strength and virility are being hyper-individualised to ‘sell’ veganism through embodied and cultural performances of ‘redemption narratives’ by vegan influencer-activist men. However, in interviews with vegan men in Britain, their relation to these meatless masculinities was found to be in tension with hegemonic masculinity. Interviewees instead related their veganism to an ungoverning of masculine bodily ideals. Veganism was revealed in the interviews as entangled with men representing themselves as part of a progressive masculinity that engages with feminist ideas, even if they are sometimes misunderstood. In this paper, I explore the prevalence and purpose of these masculinity narratives online through social media examples, before exploring a contradictory growth in the re-thinking and rejection of hegemonic masculinity within the vegan constituency through interviews. I conclude that while vegan masculinities offer the potential for men to be a little less governed by gendered norms there remains a need for vegans to more fully embrace a feminist and intersectional veganism that is not dominated by whiteness and masculinist ideals. © 2021 The Author(s).

The current research addresses this gap through developing a novel perspective on influencer marketing that highlights how consumers actively incorporate influencer content into their own practice performances. Based on a market ethnography of millennial and gen Z beauty consumers, this research uncovers six distinct actions through which consumers consume influence. Findings also challenge and update another core assumption of influencer marketing: that consumers generally perceive influencers to be similar to them. Altogether, this research introduces the Influencer Marketing Dartboard as a conceptual and managerial tool to better leverage influencers for marketing.

The policies decided by the central and local governments often provoke public reactions in the form of criticism to hate speech. DKI Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan has one of the governments figures whose policies have often been attacked by criticism and hate speech. This study aimed at analyzing the trend of Anies Baswedan's phrases. The phrases related to the handling of COVID-19 in netizen conversations in the Twitter space and collecting patterns of hate speech about Anies Baswedan in pro-government and contra-government accounts connected with the policies of handling COVID-19. This study used a virtual ethnography method against hate speech involving written verbal messages and communication objectives from Twitter users (influencers) who commented on Anies Baswedan's policies in dealing with Covid-19. The captured data come from two groups of accounts, namely government supporter and opposition. Data exploration used https://exportcomments.com/ software for comments, while trend data and public psychology (sentiment and perception) used Intelligence Socio-analytics (ISA) from March-August 2020. Data were taken from 42,393 total replies and 1,010,007 total posts for ISA. Qualitative data processing used Nvivo 12 plus to arrange phrases and speech patterns. The result showed that Anies Baswedan associated with COVID-19 had significantly increased since march 2020 and decreased in the following months. The tweets about Anies Baswedan had built public psychology in anticipatory emotions and anger, neutral and positive sentiments. The majority public's perception of Anies Baswedan is disgusting. Pro-government accounts had made Anies Baswedan the theme of conversation in their tweets. The narrative that was built was to criticize and or belittle the governor's policies and actions.

The proposed method is a combination of Knowledge Graph and Deep Learning approaches. Particularly, an effective Knowledge Graph is built to represent the interaction activities of users. Besides, an unsupervised deep learning model based on Variational Graph Autoencoder is also constructed to further learn and explore the behavior of users. This model is inspired by conventional Graph Convolutional layers. It is not only able to learn the attribute of users themselves but also enhanced to automatically extract and learn from the relationships among users. The model is robust to unseen data and takes no labeling effort. To ensure the state of the art and fashionable for this work, the dataset is collected by a designed crawling system. The experiments show significant performance and promising results which are competitive and outperforms some well-known Graph-convolutional-based. The proposed approach is applied to build a management system for an influencer marketing campaign, called ADVO system. The ADVO system can detect emerging influencers for a determined brand to run its campaign, and help the brand to manage its campaign.

We conducted an online experiment with a 3 (source: brand versus influencer without sponsorship disclosure versus influencer with sponsorship disclosure) × 2 (CSR appeals: presence versus absence) × 2 (product type: bottled water versus sofa covers) mixed design. The findings indicate that CSR appeals decreased consumers’ critical evaluations of advertising and increased purchase intentions. In addition, sponsorship disclosure raised consumers’ advertising recognition. The brand was less likely to trigger conceptual and attitudinal persuasion knowledge than was the influencer. The overall findings suggest that CSR appeals benefit a brand by reducing consumers’ critical attitudes toward an advertisement, especially when the brand promotes its own product rather than using an influencer. © 2021 American Academy of Advertising."

Focusing on both sport and esports, this study finds the social media factors contributing in the sentiment formation and commenting behavior on Twitter and proposes a scheme for attitude modulation through identification of highly engaged nano-influencers. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental design was used as the research methodology. Data mining from Twitter using RStudio software was conducted using the keyword “cybersecurity” during the time of pandemic. Final corpus of 31,891 tweets were considered for the study. Initial sentiment analysis has been conducted to explore the consumer's emotional inclination towards cybersecurity. Further through generalized equation modeling the impact of social media attributes over the consumer's posting behavior has been analyzed. Findings: The research findings reveal that users are inherently positive towards cybersecurity adoption in sports and the factors such as number of tweets, number of positive words contained in these tweets and the authenticity of the information source boost the pre-established tweeting behavior. However, the influx of information from non-organizational sources such as trending topics and discussions have negative impact over the users. Originality/value: This study is first to explore the role of nano-influencers as communication moderators over digital social platforms. This study offers a new understanding of key contributing attributes of sentiments formation over social media and offers a scheme of selection of nano-influencers to modulate the pre-established sentiments of the users. Finally, the current study offers valuable insights into social media engagements and selection of nano-influencers for practicing marketing managers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Indeed, prior research suggests that humblebragging elicits negative responses and, hence, is less preferable than straightforward bragging. The present research seeks to examine the conditions under which humblebragging might be more effective by exploring the celebrity versus influencer in the context of social media brand endorsement. Three experimental studies show that a humblebragging (vs. bragging) endorsement increases positive brand attitude when performed by a celebrity, but decreases positive brand attitude when performed by an influencer.

Thus, this study aims to analyse influencer research and propose how to enhance the persuasion power of social recommender systems. A meta-analysis was conducted on influencer research obtained from the Web of Science core collection to this end. The meta-analysis revealed that influencers have a strong persuasion effect on consumer purchase intentions. Seven essential determinants of purchase intention were identified: trustworthiness, brand attitude, influencer’s credibility, parasocial interactions, expertise, and attractiveness.

We build on the fundamental role definitions of previous empirical studies and provide a largely automated, scalable detection of fine-grained roles. Our approach clusters users hierarchically and explains the salient features. To associate clusters with roles, we use supervised classifiers: trained by experts on completely new media, but transferable on related data. Furthermore, we employ the combination of samples in order to improve scalability and allow probabilistic assignments of user roles. Our evaluation on Twitter indicates that a) stable and reliable detection of a wide range of roles is possible b) the labeling transfers well as long as the fundamental properties don’t strongly change between datasets and c) the approaches scale well with little need for human intervention. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

A prime challenge arising from this shift in digital communication is to detect topics and events of interest. In this paper, we propose and deploy a novel Deep Learning architecture that predicts if a news topic becomes viral by analyzing social media diffusion and audience interest in current news events. The proposed solution: (i) analyzes news articles, (ii) extracts associated topics and events, (iii) matches the topics and events to filter and extract developing topics, (iv) extracts current events from Twitter and matches them to the filtered news topics, and (v) predicts audience interest in news topics using Twitter likes and retweets. We employ several feature engineering techniques to improve prediction by integrating user metadata into the training set. In our experiments, we correlate two datasets collected over several months in the same time period. The first dataset contains news articles collected from different news venues, while the second one contains tweets regarding the news. The experimental results from our real-world deployment prove that the proposed system achieves high accuracy when integrating influencers metadata and the day of the week. Thus, proving that the news topics virality prediction is improved under the assumptions that spreaders and the day of the week play a huge role in information diffusion. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

However, potential SMIs discrimination often faces the problem of insufficient available information of the long-term evolution of the network, and the existing discriminant methods based on link analysis fail to obtain more accurate results. To fill this gap, a consensus smart discriminant algorithm (CSDA) is proposed to identify the potential SMIs with the aid of attention concentration (AC) between users in a closed triadic structure. CSDA enriches and expands the users' AC information by fusing multiple attention concentration indexes (ACIs) as well as filters the noise information caused by multi-index fusion through consensus among the indexes. Specifically, to begin with, to enrich the available long-term network evolution information, the unidirectional attention concentration indexes (UACIs) and the bidirectional attention concentration indexes (BACIs) are defined; next, the consensus attention concentration index (CACI) is selected according to the principle of minimum upper and lower bounds of link prediction bias to filter noise information; the potential SMI is determined by adaptively calculating CACI among the user to be identified, unconnected user group and their common neighbor. The validity and reliability of the proposed method are verified by the actual data of Twitter. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved."

It considers how social media, such as Instagram, opens up new spaces for bodies to perform fashionability without the mediation of the fashion system. This space is potentially more “democratic,” allowing those located outside the fashion system to exhibit fashionability through personal style, presenting alternatives to the normative fashionable body. However, conversely, Instagram is also a space that is increasingly colonized by big brands and celebrity “influencers” whose accounts display similar aesthetics to mainstream fashion. By examining a range of mums/moms, not just celebrity or “micro-celebrity” accounts, the paper explores the creative display of style and explorations of their maternal body—outside the dominant fashionable ideal—to discuss how these women implicitly, sometimes explicitly, challenge the aesthetics of fashion. In articulating a “technique of the self,” this “mum style” opens space to navigate motherhood and fashionability at the same time. The aesthetic tropes of “mum style” are explored to unpack the contradictions and possibilities of this space. © 2021 The Author(s).

Nonetheless, little attention has been paid to what drives consumers’ purchase intention and engagement with sponsored content with a clear disclaimer such as “Paid Partnership.” Therefore, the present research seeks to provide insights into what drives consumer engagement and purchase intention with sponsored content and when and why such effects are observed. Conducted with an online survey, the results showed that individuals with high materialism showed greater purchase intent and higher engagement with sponsored content through hedonic enjoyment. The results also showed that the mediating role of hedonic engagement for the positive effect of materialism on purchase intent was only significant under high influencer trust.

Today, the growing body of research is dedicated to cumulative patterns on online deliberation, the predecessors of which were the concept of the spiral of silence, the silent majority hypothesis, and influencer studies. However, when applied to the dissonant, disruptive, and discontinued online discussions of today where gatewatching is much less predictable and cumulation of support is often accompanied by communicative aggression, these concepts need to be reconsidered and re-tested. Also, the current public communication online is much more multi-level than before; even within one platform, several communication layers may be defined, and their inter-relations in terms of public opinion aggregation remain under-studied. Research goal. This paper aims at discovering patterns of cumulative deliberation in online communication. We first discuss the umbrella concept of cumulative deliberation. Then, we test the dynamics of the discussion on Belarusian oppositional YouTube in terms of impact of cross-account commenting on growth of commenting within the cross-account community and the overall discussion. Method and sampling. We have collected the data by YouTube crawling. The data include all user comments of 2018 for six salient Belarusian oppositional accounts. To define the cross-account commenters, we used Gephi-based web graph reconstruction. We manually coded user posts for interactivity, aggression, and criticism. Dependencies in the dynamics of the discussion were tested by correlational and cluster analysis. Results. We have discovered that users diverged into two mutually exclusive modes of expression, namely aggressive-dialogical and (self-)critical. Of the cross-account commenters, several users demonstrated ‘cumulative’ behavior and personal opinion bubbles. While there were nearly no dependencies discovered in the dynamics of user posting, criticism and self-criticism show capacity of spurring/diminishing the dynamics of public communication online, even if commenting on the whole is cumulative, not dialogical. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Most previous studies have discussed it as a practice that is distinctive among women in limited groups, such as the Salafis. However, the number of cadar wearers has increased rapidly in recent years, such that it has now become a controversial issue in society. This study is based on the narratives of interviewees in their twenties to forties who wear cadar in Jakarta, Bandung and Makassar, as well as an analysis of the teachings of some preachers and the social media posts of influencers who encourage women to wear it.

Design/methodology/approach: Of the 484 Indonesian millennials in the sample, 278 were clients and 206 non-clients of Islamic banks. Factor analysis was used to examine the SMI dimension in the Islamic banking context. This study then used the partial least square to evaluate the proposed model and test the relationships between SMI, bank image, trust and behavioural intention. Findings: Three SMI dimensions were confirmed, i.e. expertise, celebrity and similarity. For bank clients, the findings show that SMI has a significant influence on behavioural intention and reinforces bank image and trust. For non-clients, SMI does not have a significant impact on behavioural intentions but significantly strengthens bank image and trust. Practical implications: Islamic bank managers can take benefit of this study findings by learning to foster the behavioural intentions of their millennial clients and non-clients using SMIs. Further, choosing the right SMIs for their Islamic bank is an important activity, and if they want to make a positive impact on existing and potential millennial clients, they need to choose popular millennials who are knowledgeable about the Islamic value compliance of Islamic banking services.

Drawing from signaling theory, social learning theory, and social identity theory, a structural equation model analysis was conducted to test our hypotheses and proposed model based on the survey data from 592 U.S. consumers. The research results suggest that a brand’s CSR initiatives, when endorsed by SMIs who are perceived as social media leaders in opinion and taste, directly enhance consumers’ CSR communication engagement about the initiatives and do so indirectly via the consumers’ reduced CSR skepticism.

Firstly, this study explores why SM is being used by physicians to cross horizontal (physician to physician) and stakeholder (physician to patient) boundaries prior to COVID-19. Secondly, based on the studies reviewed, this study provides insights on the practical SM implications for physician leaders working in the COVID-19 environment to actively enhance their practices, reduce public confusion and improve patient care, thus informing health-care practices. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was used to conduct a structured transparent overview of peer reviewed articles that describe physicians’ use of cross-boundary SM across several disciplines (e.g. health, information science). As a baseline assessment prior to COVID-19, the review synthesized 47 articles, identified and selected from six databases and Novanet. This study used NVivo 12 to thematical code the articles, leading to the emergence of four broad factors that influence SM use. Findings: A key reason noted in the literature for physicians use of SM to cross horizontal boundaries is to share knowledge. Regarding stakeholder boundaries, the most cited reasons are to improve patient’s health and encourage behavioural changes. Insights garnered on the practical SM implications include the need for physicians to be stronger leaders in presenting trustworthy and consistent facts about health information to the public and fellow peers. As role models for the effective use of SM tools, physician leaders can mentor and coach their colleagues and counterparts. Research limitations/implications: As this was a literature review, the authors did not collect primary data to further explore this rapidly changing and dynamic SM world. Next steps could include a survey to determine firstly, how physicians currently use SM in this COVID-19 environment, and secondly, how they could leverage it for their work. Findings from this survey will help us better understand the role of physician leaders as health-care influencers and how they could better create trust and inform the Canadian public in the health information that is being conveyed. Practical implications: Physician leaders can play a key role in positively influencing institutional support for ethical and safe SM use and engagement practices. Physicians need to participate in developing regulations and guidelines that are fundamentally to physician leader’s SM use. Central to this research would be the need to understand how physicians cross-boundary practices have changed during and potentially post COVID-19. Physician leaders also need to monitor information sources for credibility and ensure that these sources are protected. As role models for the effective use of SM tools, physician leaders can mentor and coach their colleagues and counterparts in this area. Originality/value: Although there have been studies of how physicians use SM, fewer studies explore why physician leaders’ cross boundaries (horizontal and stakeholder) using SM. Important insights are gained in physician leaders practical use of SM. Key themes that emerged included: organizational and individual, information, professional and regulations and guideline factors. These factors strengthen physician leaders understanding of areas of foci to enhance their cross-boundary interactions. There is an urgency to study the complexity of SM and the effectiveness of regulations and guidelines for physicians, who are being required, at an accelerated rate, to strengthen and increase their cross-boundary practices. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

We argue, based on the notion of circulation of meanings, how the construction of the platform’s ethos is a sign element of class struggles, and a dimension of the role of communication in the platformization of labor. We conducted a content analysis on social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube) from two delivery (iFood and Rappi) and two ride-hailing platforms (Uber and 99), the largest of the country. The categories are: “pandemic and health” (contextual dimension in relation to the pandemic); “citizenship and diversity” (recurrent dimension in the discourse of platforms, in line with the literature in the area), “relations with brands and influencers” (visibility labor of the platforms with specific stakeholders) and “workers’ representations” (as a central element of the sign dimension of the class struggles). In general, the platforms’ media strategies, focused on consumers, present meanings of charity, philanthropy, citizenship and diversity, stating they are open to the demands of workers. The workers’ demands are reframed from the perspective of sacrificial citizenship, self-help, entrepreneurship and resilience.

The emerging stream of research on the live streaming community has examined streamers’ motivations and how the viewers react to streamers. However, few studies have focused on understanding the characteristics of popular streamers. Popular streamers create tremendous business value for social media influencer investors, as they have high potential to create persuasive advertisements and endorsements for firms by promoting their products and services. We aim at examining the key characteristics associated with streamers’ viewer base, namely their personality, professionalism, and streaming affordance. Based on text mining and analyses of video content, our results show: (1) certain personality traits (such as openness) are negatively associated with both cumulative and current popularity, (2) professional players are more likely to attract a larger viewer base, and (3) social affordance, including profile building affordance, social connectivity, and social interactivity, is positively associated with both cumulative and current popularity.

To better inform the selection of the most well-targeted and effective models for advertising products, this research first analyzed UAE-based Instagram posts to explore the types of models used for different types of advertising content on Instagram. Individual interviews were then conducted with Emirati women consumers to determine the criteria they use when reviewing Instagram models in terms of the intention to purchase. Results reveal that there are three archetypal models connected with product ranges relating to (1) beauty, (2) health, and (3) fashion. Four determining factors in purchase decisions emerged, namely, (1) product effect, (2) product display, (3) the modesty of the models, and (4) the pose of the models. These last two, and most notably, the modesty of the model, is perhaps somewhat uniquely relevant to the region given the primacy of female modesty within the Islamic canon. Moreover, the majority of women interviewed stressed that they favor models who exemplify a realistic lifestyle and authentic beauty. While the goal of effortless perfection is a common one, this objective may be more dominant in this socio-cultural region, given the Islamic prescriptions on female modesty. Such a desire for an effortless perfection and authentic deception characterizes the essence of the ethos paradox of Instagram models. The value of this empirical investigation is that it highlights a potential pitfall for advertisers in making the assumption that featuring strong influencers in their advertising is necessarily an enhancement of sales potential. Moreover, it illustrates how Instagram endorsement functions in this geopolitical context and offers guidelines for optimizing Instagram advertising. © 2021 Polish Rhetoric Society.

The model provides testable predictions that match suggestive evidence on pricing of paid endorsements, reveals a novel type of inefficiency that emerges in this market, and clarifies the role of search technology and advice transparency in shaping market activity. In particular, we show that recent policies that make paid endorsements more transparent can backfire, whereas an increase in the effectiveness of the search technology that matches followers to influencers has both direct and strategic positive welfare effects.

Using a content analysis (N = 3,056) and social network analysis, we explored the role of Twitter in disseminating stigma messages about the disease and the country where the virus originated. In particular, we explored four stigma-related cues and information-related cues in message content during the pre-pandemic period (December 31, 2019–February 10, 2020). Results indicate that in the dataset, 37.6% of the Tweets had stigma cues and 34.1% Tweets contained information messages. Laypersons with Twitter handles were the primary source of stigma messages. Social media influencers were one of the primary sources for both stigma and information messages. Media organizations were also one of the primary sources of information messages.

To find useful information from such valuable data, many researchers tried to address different aspects of it for different modalities. In the case of text, NLP researchers conducted many research studies and scientific works to extract valuable information such as topics. Many enlightening works on different platforms of social media, like Twitter, tried to address the problem of finding important topics from different aspects and utilized it to propose solutions for diverse use cases.

Appreciate the balance that social enterprises need to achieve between their commercial and social impact goals. Critically evaluate the decision of outsourcing core competencies. Case overview/synopsis: In 2019, Abbas Jaffery and Sumair Saleem, founders of Washup, Pakistan, a young venture providing on-demand, high-quality and cost-effective laundry service faced a critical management dilemma as their supply chain collapsed due to a rampant surge in demand. The demand surge had been the outcome of Washup’s effort to push its services to the customers by getting vetted by a social media influencer. However, the duo was caught off guard when their supply chain could not meet the sudden increase in demand. The hesitant behavior of the informal workers to join hands with Washup had not only cost Washup this management nightmare but even left the duo at wits ends to develop a strategy that would help gain business idea acceptance from the grass root workers to whom the core competencies of washing and ironing were being outsourced. This case is a rich description of the nuances of operating an unconventional social enterprise in an emerging market and gives an insight on how behavioral change among key workers is critical in ensuring the success of ventures.

We draw on focus group and individual interviews with 37 young women who follow fitness content on Instagram and a discourse analysis of the social media presence of Patry Jordán, a famous Spanish fitness influencer. Through the concept of pedagogies of perfection, we explain how fitspiration is a gendered public pedagogy of digital health through which neoliberalism and postfeminism are disseminated, providing techniques to develop individualized projects of the self. The perfect is the horizon of expectation for continued self-optimization, where young women engage in a never-ending project of the body that also demands the improvement of psychological attitudes. Through the careful articulation of 'positive' pedagogies, the idea of imperfection or failure becomes embedded within the perfect. This production of the self both as a problem and with possibilities represents the horizon of expectation, a powerful force that leads to the belief that all women can achieve ‘successful’ feminine subjectivities while reproducing gender inequality. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

COVID-19 and its associated stressors have the potential to disrupt numerous facets of our everyday lives. Pregnant and postpartum women are especially vulnerable to changes in the availability of routine health and social care services and of their support networks. The current study sought to explore stress levels and their influencers among an international cohort of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey in 64 countries between May and June 2020. The survey was hosted on the Pregistry platform and made available in 12 languages, with respondents sought through a variety of social media platforms and parenting forums. In addition to levels of stress, we collected data related to demographics, COVID-19 exposure and worries, lifestyle changes, traditional and social media use, precautionary measures related to COVID-19, and mental health. Results: In total, 7185 women were included in our sample. We found statistically significant (p-value <0.05) reductions in stress score among older women (≥35 years of age), those either living with a partner or married, those who had graduated from college, and those with medical coverage. Higher stress scores were found among women who resided in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East, and North America compared with those in Europe. When race and ethnicity were included in the model, black women were found to have higher stress compared to white women. Level of family and community support was inversely associated with level of stress. Conclusion: Our study is one of the first to explore stress levels among pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found statistically significant differences in stress levels by age, education, marital status, region of residence, race/ethnicity and level of support. Understanding stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and exploring ways to address it, will be key to contributing to the mental and physical health of expectant and new mothers, as well as their children, in both the short and long term. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The study also aims to examine the effects of vlogger gender on viewers’ perception and on their wish to be like the vlogger. Design/methodology/approach: With an online data collection from 402 YouTube travel vlog viewers, a moderated mediation model was tested using multiple linear regression and multivariate nested linear regression. Findings: This study found that physical attractiveness, social attractiveness and credibility of travel vloggers positively affected audience wishful identification, among which credibility had the strongest impact. The effect of the travel vlogger’s social attractiveness on viewer wishful identification was even strengthened when the vlogger and the viewer were of different genders. Wishful identification partially mediated the relationship between vloggers’ attributes and viewers’ behavioral intention. Finally, the finding revealed female vloggers were perceived as more physically attractive than males, whereas male vloggers were assessed as more credible than their female counterparts.

Here we argue that all of this content, at core, is ideological and political. Communication about everyday events, actions, issues and people articulates dominant (and sometimes alternative) ideological discourses about the nature of our society. Arguably, even the most banal comments are infused with norms and values, with scripts about what should be done, what is important and what is not, based on discourses about how we should run our societies. It is in these banal and everyday instances of communication that deeper senses of who we are, and values and judgements about the social order, reside. Using a range of examples from Weibo, such as anti-Trump posts, women fitness influencers, and posts about gender inequalities in the workplace, we argue for the importance and value of looking for politics in all kinds of social media comments and platforms, not so much in terms of formal politics, but a more banal and everyday kind. This means looking deeper at all individual instances, even if at first glance they appear to represent a counter point or marginalised voices. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

In line with the social identity theory, this paper examines the effects of consumers' perceived source credibility of UGC in YouTube videos on their attitudes and behavioral intentions. Additionally, source homophily theory is included to predict the antecedent of source credibility. Design/methodology/approach: Three hundred and seventy two Generation Y respondents were interviewed using snowball sampling. Data were analyzed with component-based structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: Findings confirmed that perceived source credibility indirectly affects purchase intention (PI) and electronic word-of-mouth via attitude toward UGC. Besides, perceived source credibility mediates the effect of perceived source homophily on attitude toward UGC. Practical implications: Since today's consumers have begun to trust and rely more on UGC than company-generated content on social media when making purchase decisions, companies may reconsider democratizing certain aspects of their branding strategies. Firms may fine-tune their marketing communication budgets – not only just by sponsoring public figures and celebrities but also by nurturing coproductive engagements with independent content creators who are ordinary consumers. Endowed with their imposing credibility, these micro-influencers and prosumers have high potentials to be uplifted to brand ambassadors. Originality/value: While consumers' purchase outcome can be measured easily using metrics and analytics, the roles of source homophily in stages leading up to the purchase is still elusive. Drawing on the rich theoretical basis of source homophily may help researchers to understand not only how credibility and attitude are related to PI but also how this nexus generates positive word of mouth among UGC followers within the social media circles. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The essay begins with a discussion of ‘personal influence’ as the concept was first developed in the 1950s, outlining its historical context and initial limited application. It then shows how key ideas of Personal Influence can be seen as having been applied and embedded in the very fabric of social media itself. Yet Facebook represents a significant departure from both Katz and Lazarsfeld’s research agenda and from the market research and information regime of traditional media. Their audience research work of 1955 was avowedly public and transparent in its commitments. They were providing a market research product for advertising agencies, advertisers and media providers to re-purpose. In contrast, Facebook is private, proprietorial and opaque in its research provision. Facebook combines, under one roof, the roles of market research provider, media provider, and advertising agency. By prioritizing the collection and analysis of individual user profiles, Facebook has created a media enterprise that seamlessly integrates user-generated content, data collection, analysis, strategy, media provision and associated advertising machinery. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The aim is a more detailed explanation of the psychosemantic structure of the perception of selected domestic influencers in relation to the self-respondents and the brand, as this is where the promotional aspect of the researched topic is revealed. Theoretical starting points of the study accentuate the knowledge based on endorsement models of using celebrities in marketing communication, as well as on the concept of social psychology and persuasion. The elementary definition of the concept of influencers lies in the etymological analysis, which we supplement with the analysis of currently established scientific-professional approaches to the categorisation of influencers and also draw attention to a critical explanation of terms related to influencer marketing, such as opinion leader, brand ambassador, as well as the influencer itself. To identify social representation of celebrities and marketing communication in the semantic space of generation Z we applied a psychosemantic method of Semantic Choice Test. The results indicate a markedly positive self-concept of the studied cohort of Generation Z and its focus on professional application represented by the semantic proximity of two influencers (Sajfa and LucyPug).

The purpose of this paper is to explore whether online or digital advocacy influences customer decision-making related to the purchase of travel and tourism services. This paper will also identify the categories of influencers that stimulate purchase for travel and tourism. Influencers do want to know the kind of information customers are looking for. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a primary survey of travelers to understand their degree of dependence on online reviews while making hospitality consumption-related decisions. Findings: This paper looks at both influencer marketing and online reviews by consumers to understand consumption toward advocated brand. Influencers who are perceived as unbiased in their viewpoints are trending on social media. Consumers gain trust in reviews that disclose reviewer information, number of relevant reviews are present over a period and presence of both unbiased positive and negative recommendations related to the establishment and prices versus performance.

To simplify the complex and skillful task of retouching, this paper proposes a Deep Learning based automatic photo retouching solution. It builds upon a GAN-based architecture, trained in an unsupervised manner to instantly enhance images. However, most Deep Learning based approaches are black-boxes and provide the user little to no insight into the enhancements applied, leaving it difficult to perform minor tweaking in enhancement as per preference. Hence, we also propose an algorithm to estimate parametric modifications given a pair of images with the aim of enabling the user more in the process of image enhancement.

Our argument grounds on an analysis of 757,776 Instagram posts related to six global brands, through which we show how users create branded content by following and reproducing a memetic logic. Drawing on our empirical results and Limor Shifman’s theory of Internet memes, we introduce the notion of memetic brands. Memetic brands are collections of branded social media posts, which derive from a standard branded template that repeats from user to user with small compositional changes at every iteration and on top of which users attach expressions of their vernacular creativity. In the process, memetic brands vehiculate a hypersignification, that is, an implicit discourse on fluid and situational consumption. Through the concepts of affordances-based brand relations and memetic brands, the article contributes (from a theoretical and methodological point of view) to the emerging literature on platformization of culture. © The Author(s) 2021."

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 20,000 microblogs were collected from Irish fashion micro-influencers and analyzed through keyword classification and content analysis in NVivo. The determinants of eWOM persuasiveness for consumer engagement on social media were investigated based on Sussman and Siegal’s information adoption model. Findings: The study finds that among the four types of micro-influencers, market mavens and their eWOM messages have the highest impact on consumer engagement on social media, and it presents a repetitive and persuasive eWOM model of market mavens to increase consumer participation. Also, the study discovers that micro-influencers’ occasion-related microblogs have an increasing impact on consumer interactions whereas microblogs with brands have a decreasing engagement with consumers on social media. Originality/value: This study advances prior studies on the relationship between influencers’ eWOM messages and consumer participation on social media by the development of a persuasive eWOM model of micro-influencers to increase consumer engagement and fill in the lack of relevant literature. Also, findings provide actionable insights for marketing communication practitioners to persuade consumers to participate in eWOM communications and establish strong consumer-brand relationships on social media. © 2021, Zheng Shen."

Brisk, mysterious, and satirically critical of fads and celebrity culture, the novel invites college students to consider their own processes of development at a time when they face financial pressures combined with unprecedented access to personalized technologies that exhibit a ubiquitous ensemble of celebrities, artists, or influencers whom many of them aspire to emulate. This chapter details a method of teaching Twilight Sleep using the comparison and contrast teaching approach. With a focus on the formation of identity, the collapses in communication, and the temptations of evasion and escape, it shows ways to encourage students to analyze their generation’s circumstances in comparison to those of Wharton’s main character Pauline Manford and her family in Twilight Sleep. Suggesting that the development of technology has rendered Twilight Sleep more applicable in the 2020s than in the past decades, the chapter offers a current approach for teaching Wharton’s late-career novel. © 2021, The Author(s)."

In May of 2020, the tragic death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minnesota police has led to a surge of momentum for the Black Lives Matter movement, which has been highly visible on social media as well as in public life. As online communities grapple with how best to engage with anti-racism via the digital, a number of strategies have taken hold as methods through which individuals can actively challenge racism in their own lives and in the lives of others. Among the various strategies advocated is the idea that social media users “diversify their feed” by following Black influencers, activists, businesses, and creatives. In this short essay, we move beyond prevailing understandings of DYF as a practice to improve body image, to critically examine the ethics associated with this social media practice as a method of engagement with anti-racism. © 2021 The Author(s).

Finding communities in real-world networks is critical for analyzing complex systems in various areas ranging from collaborative information to political systems. Given the different characteristics of networks and the capability of community detection in handling a plethora of societal problems, community detection methods represent an emerging area of research. Contributing to this field, the authors propose a new community detection algorithm based on the hybridization of node and link granulation. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed algorithm utilizes a rough set-theoretic concept called closure on networks. Initial sets are constructed by using neighborhood topology around the nodes as well as links and represented as two different categories of granules. Subsequently, the authors iteratively obtain the constrained closure of these sets. The authors use node mutuality and link mutuality as merging criteria for node and link granules, respectively, during the iterations. Finally, the constrained closure subsets of nodes and links are combined and refined using the Jaccard similarity coefficient and a local density function to obtain communities in a binary network. Findings: Extensive experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks followed by a comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Research limitations/implications: The study also contributes to the ongoing effort related to the application of soft computing techniques to model complex systems. The extant literature has integrated a rough set-theoretic approach with a fuzzy granular model (Kundu and Pal, 2015) and spectral clustering (Huang and Xiao, 2012) for node-centric community detection in complex networks. In contributing to this stream of work, the proposed algorithm leverages the unexplored synergy between rough set theory, node granulation and link granulation in the context of complex networks. Combined with experiments of network datasets from various domains, the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reveal co-occurring disjoint, overlapping and nested communities without necessarily assigning each node to a community. Practical implications: This study carries important practical implications for complex adaptive systems in business and management sciences, in which entities are increasingly getting organized into communities (Jacucci et al., 2006). The proposed community detection method can be used for network-based fraud detection by enabling experts to understand the formation and development of fraudulent setups with an active exchange of information and resources between the firms (Van Vlasselaer et al., 2017). Products and services are getting connected and mapped in every walk of life due to the emergence of a variety of interconnected devices, social networks and software applications. Social implications: The proposed algorithm could be extended for community detection on customer trajectory patterns and design recommendation systems for online products and services (Ghose et al., 2019; Liu and Wang, 2017). In line with prior research, the proposed algorithm can aid companies in investigating the characteristics of implicit communities of bloggers or social media users for their services and products so as to identify peer influencers and conduct targeted marketing (Chau and Xu, 2012; De Matos et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). The proposed algorithm can be used to understand the behavior of each group and the appropriate communication strategy for that group. For instance, a group using a specific language or following a specific account might benefit more from a particular piece of content than another group. The proposed algorithm can thus help in exploring the factors defining communities and confronting many real-life challenges. Originality/value: This work is based on a theoretical argument that communities in networks are not only based on compatibility among nodes but also on the compatibility among links. Building up on the aforementioned argument, the authors propose a community detection method that considers the relationship among both the entities in a network (nodes and links) as opposed to traditional methods, which are predominantly based on relationships among nodes only. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This paper aims to take a methods-based approach to better understand employees’ roles as influencers. As such, its objective is to operationalize and apply the three EBE dimensions – brand consistent behavior, brand endorsement and brand allegiance – using Instagram data. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research uses a case study of employee influencers at SoulCycle, a leading North American fitness company and examines 100 Instagram images and 100 captions from these influential employees to assess the three EBE dimensions. Findings: Brand consistent behavior (what employees do) was the most important EBE dimension indicating that employees’ social media activities align with their employer’s values. Brand allegiance (what employees intend to do in the future) whereby employees self-identify with their employer on social media, followed. Brand endorsement (what employees say) was the least influential of the three EBE dimensions, which may indicate a higher level of perceived authenticity from a consumer perspective. Originality/value: This research makes three contributions. First, it presents a novel measure of EBE using public Instagram data. Second, it represents a unique expansion and an evolution of King et al.’s (2012) model. Third, it considers employees’ work-related content on social media to understand employees’ role as influencers and their co-creation of EBE, which is currently an under-represented perspective in the internal branding literature. © 2021, Jenna Jacobson, Donna Smith and Janice L.

Trump’s use of the platform. Although previous work has been done studying the content of Trump’s tweets, there remains a dearth of research exploring who opinion leaders were in the early days of his presidency and what they were tweeting about. Therefore, this study retroactively investigates opinion leaders on Twitter during Trump’s 1st month in office and explores what those influencers tweeted about. We uniquely used a historical data set of 3 million tweets that contained the word “trump” and used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a probabilistic algorithmic model, to extract topics from both general Twitter users and opinion leaders. Opinion leaders were identified by measuring eigenvector centrality and removing users with fewer than 10,000 followers. The top 1% users with the highest score in eigencentrality (N = 303) were sampled, and their attributes were manually coded. We found that most Twitter-based opinion leaders are either media outlets/journalists with a left-center bias or social bots. Immigration was found to be a key topic during our study period. Our empirical evidence underscores the influence of bots on social media even after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, providing further context to ongoing revelations and disclosures about influence operations during that election. Furthermore, our results provide evidence of the continued relevance of established, “traditional” media sources on Twitter as opinion leaders. © The Author(s) 2021."

The development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, social media, and other Industry 4.0 influencers pushed technology into a smart society's framework, bringing potential vulnerabilities to sensor data, services, and smart city applications. These vulnerabilities lead to data security problems. We propose a decentralized data management system for smart and secure transportation that uses blockchain and the Internet of Things in a sustainable smart city environment to solve the data vulnerability problem. A smart transportation mobility system demands creating an interconnected transit system to ensure flexibility and efficiency. This article introduces prior knowledge and then provides a Hyperledger Fabric-based data architecture that supports a secure, trusted, smart transportation system. The simulation results show the balance between the blockchain mining time and the number of blocks created. We also use the average transaction delay evaluation model to evaluate the model and to test the proposed system's performance.

We characterize cross-platform similarities and differences in popular sources, diffusion patterns, influencers, coordination, and automation. Comparing the two platforms, we find divergence among the prevalence of popular low-credibility sources and suspicious videos.

Findings show that even though the society is being influenced by the brands, this increasing awareness for a 'healthy diet' could be something positive for the society, however the conclusions are that it is not. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

To this end, social media influencers act as a dynamic third-party endorser to spread a brand's message to vast audience across the world. Consumers who exhibit a positive attitude towards the social media credibility are attracted through social media advertisements. The present study examines the perceptions of agencies for opting social media influencers and their role in customer engagement and brand awareness. For this purpose, the study also assesses different methods adopted by these influencers for influencing customers using a systematic review. The findings of the study indicate customer's perception and attitude are much influenced via these influencers since they are more capable of communicating to a niche segment.

Recently, there were studies on the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which aimed to identify influencers that can spread influence to a wider audience. The complex social media network requires efficient IM algorithms, in which small improvements will lead to a performance boost. In this research, recent articles on IM were reviewed. This review aims to identify the current approaches, enhancements, factors, diffusion models, and objectives of IM. In typical IM formulation, a social network is represented as a graph with nodes (user) and edges (relation). There are graph-based and non-graph-based IM approaches. Graph-based IM approaches include greedy and heuristic algorithms. The objectives of IM studies were optimizations on large or complex networks, on unknown networks, using bandit, using relation impacts, or general optimization. IM algorithms were continuously getting better. However, there are aspects that are still improvable, i.e. pre-calculation, thresholds estimation, seeds selection, integration of neural networks, and more importantly, real-life validation methods. This study will help in identifying possible improvements based on current IM limitations. Effective IM methods will help business users to identify influencers more accurately. © 2021, Paulus Editora. All rights reserved."

But what precisely does it mean to be “postdigital” if you are an Arab woman or social actor in the Global South? How does access to social networking sites, while increasing visibilities, also provide potential for increased agency? This study is concerned with the extent to which Arab women’s self-presentation practices on Instagram could be considered as empowering, or otherwise, within the postdigital condition. First, the study takes Instagram as a case to develop a theoretical framework for considering social media as a tertiary artifact, involving material, routine-symbolic, and conceptual affordances. Second, it applies the artifact framework to explore a corpus of self-presentations by five Arab women influencers. Feminist postdigital theorizing offers unique contributions to problematizing normative, ethnocentric, and neoliberal conceptions of Arab women’s empowerment. The application of the novel framework leads to an interpretative discussion of Arab women’s influencing practices across merging offline/online and transnational boundaries. Overall, the critical perspective begins to reimagine Arab women’s empowerment, not simply as individualized or material processes, but as agencies that are interwoven within the commercialized and conceptual dynamics of visual social media. © The Author(s) 2021."

They also deepen surveillance of influencer content by brand stakeholders, who are concerned that influencers will err and be “cancelled” (risking their investments in content). My critical framework synthesizes feminist critiques of ostensibly participatory influencer industries with close attention to critical algorithmic studies. This article provides an in-depth look at how brand risk and brand safety are predicted and measured using one tool, Peg. Through a “walk through” of this tool, underpinned by a wider industry ethnography, I demonstrate how value-laded algorithmic judgments map onto well-worn hierarchies of desirability and employability that originate from systemic bias along the lines of class, race, and gender. © The Author(s) 2021."

The theoretical performance of IM has become matured. However, it is not enough since IM has to be implemented in a social media environment. Realistic IM algorithms and diffusion models have been proposed, such as the addition of user factors or a learning agent. However, most studies still relied on the influence spread benchmark, which makes the usefulness questionable. This research is among the first IM study using Instagram data. In this study, two diffusion models are proposed, which are based on the original IC and LT models, with the addition of the engagement grade (EG) factor. An algorithm called IMFS (IM with followers score) is proposed to accommodate the new models as well as IC and LT. In addition, realistic benchmark methods are proposed, namely the average engagement of the activated users, and the overlapping between post likers and activated users. The result shows that the proposed models are 2-3x more realistic if compared to IC and LT. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved."

We examine this question through a qualitative study of YouTube “drama” channels. Drama creators cover the conflicts and scandals taking place among top YouTube celebrities. As producers of meta-commentary, they often rely on metrics as indicators of influence and celebrity on YouTube, thus constituting a relevant site to examine the connection between social media metrics and status. Based on interviews with English-speaking drama creators, we report three main findings. First, creators have a double orientation toward YouTube, which they understand as a site of both economic opportunities and tight-knit relationships. Second, the meanings that creators attach to metrics—their own and the ones of top YouTubers—reflect this double orientation: for them, metrics correlate with economic revenue and social status. Due to this central and multifaceted role of metrics, we find that traffic numbers can turn into a spectacle of their own for drama creators. Third, even in a context in which metrics are central, we identify several distancing strategies on the part of creators. We conclude by discussing whether—and why—resistance to metrics can be found everywhere. © The Author(s) 2021."

Design/methodology/approach: The research team conducted a longitudinal, netnographic study of the YouTube beauty community, involving an initial phase of netnographic immersion followed by an investigative netnography that examined community members’ response to celebrity endorsements by 12 SMIs within the community. Findings: This study identifies five recurring celebrity endorsement transgressions, each violating an established moral responsibility within the community. The paper explores how community members attribute responsibility for transgressive endorsements and identifies consequences for both the SMI and the endorsed brand. Research limitations/implications: This study focused on a single consumption community, developing a deep understanding of the distinct moral responsibilities that shape the reception of celebrity endorsements within this context. Practical implications: The paper presents managerial recommendations that will aid both SMIs and brands in implementing celebrity endorsements that avoid communal perceptions of transgression.

Tobacco smoke is the epidemic of modern times due to its tremendous burden of diseases and deaths, greater than that produced by alcohol, AIDS, drugs, road accidents, murders and suicides combined. In Italy, 26% of the population smokes and the high prevalence of smoking even among young people is crucial for the Tobacco Industry, because young people are the reservoir which replaces smokers who quit or die. The aim of this study is to investigate smoking habits and determinants of smoking among young adults. Methods. This cross-sectional study enrolled young people from three Italian regions: Latium (central Italy) Calabria (southern Italy) and Sicily (the largest Italian island). An anonymous, multiple-choice online questionnaire was distributed through social networks. Questions investigated individual habits and lifestyles (smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption, physical activity), the presence of smokers in the family and the use of electronic cigarettes. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were used to describe the characteristics of the sample and to evaluate factors associated with smoking status. All statistical analyses were conducted in SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All hypothesis tests were 2-tailed and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results. In a sample of 382 subjects between 18 and 34 years, the prevalence of smoking was 25%. A statistically significant higher percentage of smokers is observed among those who drink coffee and those who drink alcohol. Only 48% of smokers usually smoke classic cigarettes, while 45% roll their own cigarettes and 7% use electronic cigarettes. More than half of the smokers, smoke 1 to 5 cigarettes a day, while 17% smoke over 10 cigarettes a day. In families where there was at least 1 smoker, the percentage of smokers was 34% versus only 15% in families where nobody else smokes. The presence of at least 1 smoker in the family was strongly associated with young adults’ smoking behavior: subjects with family members who smoke were more than three times as likely to be current smokers, compared to those with no family smokers (Odds Ratio [OR] = 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8–5.5, p=0.0001). Alcohol, coffee consumption, unemployment and being a student were also found to be independently and significantly associated with smoking of young adults (alcohol OR=2.96, 95%CI 1.64–5.34; coffee OR= 4.33, 95%CI 1.81–10.39; unemployment OR = 4.76, 95%CI 1.26–17.96; being a student OR = 3.21, 95%CI 1.25–8.27). Conclusions. Preventing young people from smoking is crucial in order to stop the Tobacco Epidemic. The Tobacco Industry is selling new products and is using new marketing tactics (i.e. the “influencers” in social media) which are hooking young people to addictive products and behaviors, thus threatening to wipe out decades of progress in curbing tobacco use. Effective action to drastically reduce new and old types of smoking or to pursue the “Tobacco Endgame” requires an increasing commitment not only towards young people, but also towards families, that play an important role in influencing young people. © 2021.

The discussion responds to the journal's call for papers by examining the clean eating trend as a vehicle for the ideals of white femininity, and the techniques of femininity that are employed to convey messages of normalcy and exceptionalism in this contemporary popular food culture. In the analysis of an article in the high-end home interiors magazine, Elle Decoration, the visual authoritativeness of clean eating advocates is considered to highlight the strategies and devices used to deploy ideals of white femininity and to create boundaries around a remodeled white female neoliberal self. The article aims to advance current debates regarding digital foodwork, by examining the esthetics of whiteness that are contained within the message of relatability communicated by social media food influencers.

The main purpose of this research is to analyse whether anti-consumption-framed content (anti-hauls) generates more views, more dislikes (and less dislikes) and more comments, as customer engagement components, than pro-consumption-framed content (hauls). Design/methodology/approach: Based on 160 videos published on YouTube by 80 influencers on their respective channels, this study mainly analyses whether there are differences between anti-consumption and pro-consumption content in the various elements that constitute customer engagement (i.e. number of views, likes, dislikes and comments). Findings: Results indicate that there are differences between anti-consumption and pro-consumption content in terms of total number of views, likes, dislikes and comments. All these customer engagement components are higher for anti-consumption-framed videos, which offers interesting implications for both theory and practice. Originality/value: This study extends previous literature by accounting content published by social media influencers on their social media accounts, instead of analysing the most traditionally studied content that is published by brands on their own social media; and classifying this content as anti/pro-consumption rather than using the traditional dichotomy between transactional/emotional content. Brands should pay special attention to the content generated by social media influencers because it is a powerful form of electronic word-of-mouth that currently plays a significant role in customers’ (non)purchase decisions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

With the emergence of the internet, the nature of social networks changed because communities could form disassociated from physical location, and social network analysis (SNA) on social media such as Twitter and Facebook emerged as a distinct research field. Studies suggest that Twitter feeds have a significant influence on the views and opinions of society, and subsequently the formation of communities. This paper reports on a study where social network analysis was performed on Twitter feeds in South Africa around the 2019 elections to detect distinct patterns within the overall network. In the datasets that were analysed, a specific network pattern namely Broadcast Networks were observed. A Broadcast Network typically reflects central hubs such as media houses, political parties or influencers whose messages are repeated without interaction or discussion. Our results indicate that there were few discussions and interactions and that messages were broadcasted from central nodes even though the general experience of Twitter users during this time was of intense discussions and differences in opinion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

These PSRs, however, have been neglected in previous experimental studies on SMIs because they used non-followers as their study participants. This paper, therefore, analyzes the impact of SMIs on their respective followers and reports the results of two experiments. The first experiment (N = 144) confirmed that follower status (non-followers/followers) affected the strength of PSRs, source credibility, and evaluation of a sponsored Instagram post. The second experiment (N = 157) additionally included the presence or absence of an advertising disclosure. Although there were no group differences in conceptual persuasion knowledge, the results indicated that followers, who had established a strong PSR with the SMI, reported lower evaluative persuasion knowledge. Furthermore, followers reported enhanced purchase intentions and brand evaluations, especially when the posts contained advertising disclosures. © 2021 Advertising Association."

Usage of Internet and specifically social media platforms for promoting businesses and services has seen a drastic increase in the recent times. Influencer-based marketing is a major area for promotion. With its major dominance, comes its downsides. This influencer-based model alternatively being referred to as influencer marketing has a major drawback which concerns one of the foremost aspects of digital media, organic and inorganic results. Many of the social media platforms involve inorganic audience which includes fake popularity for the concerned account. This heavily impacts the advertisements business being run on social media and other platforms. This could lead to wrong audience impact involving losses for the business as well as the customers being targeted. In this study, a trust-based model is designed in which the social media platform, Instagram, is checked for fake audience involvement and their consecutive detection for better future impressions. For the detection of inorganic audience involvement, firstly, a study is done regarding the parameters that could assist the detection process. These parameters are further used to generate the nodes of a decision tree. Second of all, the dataset is prepared for the detection process. Machine learning is used to make the predictions on the dataset as with minimum human intervention, it can help automate the entire process and make it much faster than manual detection. Decision tree is then applied to the dataset for building a prediction based model, which is used to predict the occurrence of fake accounts in test dataset. This is followed by the concluding of the result in which prediction has been done. Also, the accuracy of the same has been checked in the conclusion with the help of confusion matrix which turns out to have a good accuracy, thus, successfully concluding the study. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021."

However, there has been little attention paid to how SMIs might change the way people process a commercial specifically designed to enhance corporate reputation. Three studies were conducted to understand possible influencer impacts on how people respond to commercials designed to enhance corporate reputation. In Study 1, we found that when a commercial was introduced by an influencer, message attitudes and perceived corporate reputation were more positive via reduced persuasion knowledge (PK), as compared to the impact of the commercial presented by itself. In Study 2, the influencer enhancement effect disappeared when sponsorship was disclosed, again as mediated by increased PK. The findings are consistent with prior research; however, this research is the first to explore disclosure effects in the context of corporate reputation with video stimuli. In Study 3, the style of the influencer’s message (narrative versus nonnarrative) influenced response to the corporate commercials, with a narrative introduction engendering more favorable message attitudes and corporate reputation perceptions through decreased PK. However, the positive effect of an influencer’s narrative introduction occurred only when sponsorship was not disclosed. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising."

The current study investigates relevant mechanisms that explain the effectiveness of Instagram posts contingent upon their account types (commercial brand's Instagram account versus influencer's Instagram account) and content types (the absence versus presence of human figures in the posted contents). Design/methodology/approach: Conducting an online experiment (N Females = 195), it was tested if parasocial interaction (PSI) and feelings of social presence moderate the effects of Instagram accounts' promotional posts on consumers' perceived trustworthiness of the endorsed fashion brand. The experiment employed a 2 (Type of Instagram posts: product-only posts versus product posts with a person content) × 2 (Type of Instagram account: a fashion-brand account versus a a fashion-influencer account) between-subjects factorial design. Findings: Results demonstrate three-way interaction effects among the type of the Instagram account, the type of Instagram posts and PSI/social presence on the perceived trustworthiness of a brand. When the content is coming from a fashion-influencer account, there is no difference between product posts with a person and product-only posts conditions with regard to the positive relationship between PSI/social presence and trustworthiness. In contrast, when the source is a fashion-brand account on Instagram, the positive relationship between PSI/social presence and trustworthiness is stronger for product posts with a person. These findings suggest that Instagram posts that are promoted by fashion influencers would have similar effects of PSI and social presence, even if they do not appear themselves in the branded content. Originality/value: This research contributes to our understanding of the effective antecedents of trustworthiness in social media-based fashion marketing and fashion brand management. Instagram account types and content types influence the extent to which social media communication allows for the formation of emotional ties with and positive evaluation of the fashion brand. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The population of this study entails all followers of aesthetic dermatology clinics on their Instagram accounts. However, only three influencers from the aesthetic dermatology industry were selected and approved the request of sharing the survey instrument on their official platforms. Overall, 600 surveys were distributed, but only 384 were completed fully, constituting a 64% response rate. Findings: The data analysis revealed an excellent fit for the data and indicated an impact of attractiveness and expertise on online engagement and PI. Moreover, a mediating influence was also found for online engagement on the path between influencer credibility and PI. Research limitations/implications: This study has a limitation of collecting the data from only three influencers; consequently, collecting data from the followers of more than four influencers would get more generalizable results. Second, considering further, examining the mediating role of other variables such as electronic word-of-mouth (EWOM) and loyalty programs could also provide further insights onto the nature of the factors affecting the PI. In addition, future studies should examine the differences of using more than one social media platform. Practical implications: The main findings of this study have a number of managerial implications for marketing management that hint at liking the influencers who are highly trusted owing to their extensive expertise in the area they are marketing rather than only depending on their physical attractiveness. The Jordanian culture does not focus only on the image shared by the social media as the reviews can either support or decline the influence of even the celebrity. Significantly, a set of managerial implications come from the current research. Social implications: Two major areas are the most important; these are the trustworthy issue and the EWOM. The marketers should encourage their customers to openly talk about their experiences as they have an imperative role in liking influencers in a way that improves their PI. The second implication is related to social media platforms management that marketing managers should resolve any negative EWOM caused and to enhance followers’ satisfaction levels of the services. The increase in satisfaction positively affects PI, and the service makes the influencer role become more effective. Originality/value: This study was able to add a value to the current understanding of the main antecedents of customer engagement by looking at these dimensions of perceived credibility. Another contribution was captured in this study by successfully validating the meditating impact of customer engagement between influencers’ credibility dimensions and PI, especially in the absence of the studies that have addressed such relationship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study is based on a unique database that combines a sample of one year of Twitter conversations about an Italian bank and its daily business performances (i.e. number of closures and openings). The relationship between these two is analyzed using autoregressive time series models (VAR). Findings: Findings indicate that a tweet affects a bank’s outcomes only when embedded in a larger conversation about the bank, rather than simply repetitively shared. These findings contribute to two debates within bank marketing literature. First is the debate about the role of infomediaries in banks' outcomes, as it urges to reconsider the way banks' online reputation is conceptualized and measured. Second is the debate on opportunities and threats of social media for the banking industry, as it indicates that negative sentiment expressed by the general public influences not only stock markets but also directly banks' outcomes. Originality/value: This study allows managers and corporations to understand what to do when conversations of unknown individuals become threatening for the company. To influence such situations, the company should identify not only the actors that are influencers but also the communications that have been popular in the past for their brand or the brand of their competitors and monitor the conversational volume and broadness. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

As a Muslim, cosmetic surgery must be evaluated from a jurisprudential lens to determine the level of necessity of the procedure, whether it reached the stage of essential (darurah), or necessity (hajah), or complimetary (tahsinah), along with close inspection of the maslahah dan mafsadah involved with the aspect of maslahah dan mafsadah in need of further clarification. A close inspection of medical fatwas relating to cosmetic surgery reveals that procedures that are intended solely for physical beautification with no medical justification whatsoever are forbidden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study collect data from fatwas issued by seven fatwa institutions worldwide, will look into the application of maqasid al-shariʿa in determining the legal status of cosmetic surgery in Islam. The data was analysed thematically. RESULT: The findings from this study suggest that all fatwas pertaining to cosmetic surgery were decided based on the considerations of maqasid al-shariʿa, which will greatly aid doctors and patients in evaluating the need, or the lack thereof, to proceed with cosmetic surgery.

The article updates technology and social media scholar danah boyd’s foundational work on “networked publics” to offer the framework of “refracted publics.” While “networked publics” arose from media and communication studies of social network sites during the decade of the 2000s, focused on platforms, infrastructure, and affordances, “refracted publics” is birthed from anthropological and sociological studies of internet user cultures during the decade of the 2010s, focused on agentic and circumventive adaptations of what platforms offer them. “Refracted publics” are a product of the landscape of platform data leaks, political protests, fake news, and (most recently) COVID-19, and are creative vernacular strategies to accommodate for perpetual content saturation, hyper-competitive attention economies, gamified and datafied metric cultures, and information distrust. The key conditions (transience, discoverability, decodability, and silosociality) and dynamics (impactful audiences, weaponized contexts, and alternating publics and privates) of “refracted publics” allow cultures, communities, and contents to avoid being registered on a radar, register in misplaced pockets while appearing on the radar, or register on the radar but parsed as something else altogether.

Objective: This article provides a narrative literature review of the growing number of social research studies published over the past decade that investigate the types of digital technologies used by children and young people in the Global North, in addition to investigating which of these technologies they find most useful or not useful. Key findings as well as major gaps and directions for future research are identified and discussed. Methods: A comprehensive search of relevant publications listed in Google Scholar was conducted, supported by following citation trails of these publications. The findings are listed under type of digital technology used for health: Cross-media, internet, social media, apps and wearable devices, sexual health support and information, and mental health support and information. Results: Many young people in the Global North are active users of digital health technologies. However, it is notable that they still rely on older technologies, such as websites and search engines, to find information. Apps and platforms that may not have been specifically developed for young people as digital health resources often better suit their needs. Young people appreciate the ready availability of information online, the opportunities to learn more about their bodies and health states, and the opportunities to learn how to improve their health and physical fitness. They enjoy being able to connect with peers, and they find emotional support and relief from distress by using social media platforms, YouTube, and online forums. Young people can find the vast reams of information available to them difficult to navigate. They often look to trusted adults to help them make sense of the information they find online and to provide alternative sources of information and support. Face-to-face interactions with these trusted providers remain important to young people. Risks and harms that young people report from digital health use include becoming overly obsessed with their bodies' shape and size when using self-tracking technologies and comparing their bodies with the social media influencers they follow. Conclusions: Further details on how young people are using social media platforms and YouTube as health support resources and for peer-to-peer sharing of information, including attention paid to the content of these resources and the role played by young social media influencers and microcelebrities, would contribute important insights to this body of literature. The role played by visual media, such as GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format) and memes, and social media platforms that have recently become very popular with young people (eg, Snapchat and TikTok) in health-related content creation and sharing requires more attention by social researchers seeking to better understand young people's use of digital devices and software for health and fitness. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The results show that both factors act as determinants of followers’ perceived influence, which in turn predicts followers’ positive word-of-mouth (WOM) about recommended brands and purchase intention. In fact, perceived influence plays a mediating role in these relationships. Positive WOM and purchase intention are also significantly related. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the nature and effects of the persuasive power of social media influencers. Key implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed. © 2021 Westburn Publishers Ltd."

However, the unique elements and phenomena for user-generated short video ads through mobile platforms have not yet been investigated. Therefore, a theoretical framework is proposed to explain the effect of user-generated social media short video ads on product sales from the perspective of advertisement sociability and vividness attributes, especially considering the moderation effect of advertisement content generators, including influencers, sellers and buyers. An empirical study using data from the Douyin platform and the Taobao e-commerce platform was conducted using dynamic panel models. The results indicate that the number of comments as one of the advertisement sociability attributes and female vividness and music vividness as two of the advertisement vividness attributes have consistently positive effects on product sales. The moderating effects of the influencer and the seller are positive for the effect of sociability on product sales, whereas the moderating effect of the buyer is positive for the effect of vividness on product sales. Thus, the best strategy to promote products through user-generated short video ads on mobile short video sharing platforms is for buyers to publish short video ads with music and a female or both a male and a female together; moreover, having a large number of comments increases product sales. © 2021 Advertising Association."

As social networking sites robustly permeated different facets of society, they have been commonly grouped under the more generic term ""social media."" Social media has become a powerful force in contemporary life, paving the way for the rise of digital participatory cultures and social movements. More recently, the culture of cancellation has entered the vernacular of digital culture, primarily targeted at public figures who break the loose norms of social acceptability. Specifically, cancel culture is a form of public shaming initiated on social media to deprive someone of their usual clout or attention with the aim of making public discourse more diffused and less monopolized by those in positions of privilege. Conversely, cancel culture has also been framed as a form of intolerance against opposing views. In this essay, I unpack the nuances and implications of cancel culture through Neil Alperstein's concept of ""virtual collective consciousness."" In Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, cancel culture has become more demonstrable on social media. I will use a case study of a public figure from the Philippines who has been subjected to cancel culture in order to examine the complexity of this social phenomenon. © 2020 Aesthetics Media Services.

To explore how health influencers in China communicate with their followers, we conducted a content analysis of the top ten health influencers’ posts (n = 1000) on Sina Weibo guided by the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM) and the transportation theory. These posts were coded in terms of demographic information, topics, message properties (informative, persuasive, and interactive), EPPM variables, and types of evidence (statistical and narrative) used. Results showed that these influencers had a clear emphasis on women’s health (OB/GYN diseases and risks related to pregnancy and childcare) and beauty and skincare (in terms of risks and benefits). Overall, they used low fear appeal and high efficacy messages. However, messages containing efficacy information were less likely to be liked. These influencers relied heavily on narrative evidence; however, there was no significant relationship between the use of either narrative or statistical evidence and the number of likes. Differences in the communication strategies in posts about different diseases did exist but were not prevalent. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

As consumers turn to social media platforms, organizations are realizing the power of influencers in affecting a purchase decision. The current study throws light on various aspects of influencer marketing that drive consumer behavior by using the theory of planned behavior (henceforth referred to as TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) and social learning theory by Bandura and Walters (1963) as part of the qualitative research to identify key factors of influencer marketing that impact consumer behavior. The study revealed that both attitude toward influencers and perceived behavior control that allows increase in domain knowledge had a favorable impact on consumer behavior while the influence of peers had no effect. Further additional constructs namely personal relevance, inspiration, and trust had a positive impact on behavior while perceived risk did not have any effect. Product influencer fitment was an important criterion for consumers, as they followed the specific type of influencers for different product categories. Depending on the posts shared by influencers, consumers are impacted at four levels: increase in brand awareness, subject matter expertise, brand preference, and preference.

To address the gap in scientific evidence on the general motivation of the social media users to engage and co-create viral Internet challenges, our study was conducted in the context of popular social media apps in India. Based on a review of literature, a conceptual model was proposed and empirically tested. The influence of personal factors, outward motivations and inner motivations were also mapped in this study. Finally, we also investigated the influence of gender roles we play—specifically masculinity/femininity. It was observed that important drivers of the intent to participate in Internet viral challenges were the respondents’ need to belong to a group, lack of immediacy of rewards and the ability to showcase personal strengths mattered. The association of influencers with the viral challenge significantly increased the likelihood of participation. The most interesting finding was the impact of gender identity in driving participation in viral Internet challenges. Those who identified higher on masculine traits were more likely to display an intent to participate and it was the converse for feminine traits. This effect was independent of the impact of gender. Our analysis suggests an interesting and hitherto unexplored dimension of viral Internet challenges—there is something in them that saliently appeals to our inherent masculinity.

Clarification of this concept is essential to understand the necessary characteristics and potential opportunities for the nurse influencer. Methods: Walker and Avant's method of concept synthesis and analysis was used. Results: With time, self-efficacy, and a measurable intention, a nurse can become a nurse influencer. A nurse influencer is a nurse who has a platform to affect change through demonstrating integrity, a dedication to learning, and excellent communication of ideas and information. In addition to creating change, the nurse influencer may also disseminate knowledge and generate empowerment for themselves and others. Conclusion: This concept analysis, the first focusing on the nurse influencer, provides an explanation of this concept and a concept map of the nurse influencer's attributes and contributions. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC"

While a few studies examined how influencers can incite behavioural change or affect public opinion, the majority of studies focussed on the use of influencers as a commercial marketing tactic. Using Stern’s Revised Communication Model for Advertising as a theoretical framework, the studies were classified according to three research characteristics: source, message, and audience. The first research stream focussed on the perspectives of influencers and communication professionals. The second stream was concerned with the content strategies used by influencers in their sponsored posts.

This study describes characteristics of Instagram posts from three popular cannabis vaporizer brands in the U.S. Methods: A content analysis was performed on posts uploaded between October 2017 and October 2018 by the brands Kandypens (n = 731), G Pen (n = 454), and Pax (n = 71). Posts were coded for: characteristics of individuals pictured, health and risk statements, references to cannabis, co-marketing activities, cartoon images, and product price. Descriptive statistics highlight the prevalence of these characteristics and between-brand differences. Results: Posts had a wide reach, with a total of 467,700 followers across brands. Two-thirds (68.0 %) of posts depicted someone using the product. Among posts featuring a person, (83.9 %) depicted female users. Overall, cannabis was rarely mentioned (8.9 %) or depicted (10.0 %) in posts. “Tagging” social media influencers (34.3 % of posts) and other companies or their products (31.9 % of posts) were popular promotional strategies. Few posts mentioned age restrictions (0.3 %), health risks (5.2 %), or health benefits (0.2 %).

Social media apps such as Twitter are being increasingly adopted for knowledge dissemination and research purposes. Twitter polls are a unique feature which allows for a rapid response to questions posed. Nonetheless Twitter does not constitute a validated survey technique. The objective was to compare the similarities of Twitter polls in describing practice patterns for the treatment of rectal cancer. Methods A survey on the management of rectal cancer was designed using modified Delphi methodology. Surgeons were contacted through major colorectal societies to participate in an online survey. The same set of questions were periodically posted by influencers on Twitter polls and the results were compared. Results A total of 753 surgeons participated in the online survey. Individual participation in Twitter ranged from 162 to 463 responses. There was good and moderate agreement between the two methods for the most popular choice (9/10) and the least popular choice (5/10), respectively. Discussion It is possible that in the future polls available via social media can provide a low-cost alternative and an efficient, yet pragmatic method to describe clinical practice patterns. This is the first study comparing Twitter polls with a traditional survey method in medical research. Conclusions There is viable opportunity to enhance the performance of research through social media, however, significant refinement is required. These results can potentially be transferable to other areas of medicine. © 2021 Author(s) (or their employer(s))."

The study leverages a unique dataset of Instagram influencers compiled by scraping an online influencer database to test its hypotheses. The findings indicate that follower count and content volume are negatively associated with follower engagement, while followee count is positively associated with follower engagement. However, these main effects are modified by influencers' domains of interest.

With the ubiquity of Web 2.0 in people’s everyday lives, images can now be shared instantaneously via social media platforms. The quest for ‘photo-trophies’ that can be liked, shared and reproduced may influence how tourists behave around wildlife. Trends such as the ‘wildlife selfie’, which requires closeness to unpredictable animal species, is gaining popularity and may contribute to harassment of wildlife. This paper reports on qualitative research involving tour providers offering in-water encounters with marine wildlife and their experiences of the influence of social media on their clients’ behaviour. Semi-structured interviews with operators at three case study sites in the South Pacific revealed a consistent theme of ‘pushy’ behaviour displayed by skilled wildlife photographers and social media ‘influencers’. Such behaviour fosters the potential for wildlife harassment and provoking animal behaviour that could pose hazard for people. The operators interviewed identified professional wildlife photographers and influencers being most likely to ignore safety instructions and guidelines. The findings illustrate that investigating operator-client relationships from the perspective of the operator can provide important insights into tourist behaviour.

Findings show that engagement level vary at continent level and territorial dynamics are determined by cultural similarities, especially on the West-East axis. Implications and associated research avenues are discussed to develop insights for assessing the value of different types of influencers in affecting territorial dynamics, both in tourism management and in designing the evolution of rural areas towards a sustainable-oriented image. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."

This study investigates the structure, interaction patterns, opinion leaders and communities’ distribution of actors involved in cross-national halal food Twitter networks. A social network analysis (SNA) is employed using a data scraping software to collect around 12,000 halal food tweets. A relatively low density and heterogeneous hub-and-spoke network emerged, with only few influencers/social mediators within small communities controlling the diffusion of information through the network. This result lends strong support to the “Matthew Effect”, which is a variation of the “rich get richer” model. Robustness checks confirmed the existence of small world preferential attachment network linking digital halal food consumers.

One of the major affordances of Instagram is the creation and posting of pictures. This allows for the production of photographic self-representations–one of the central aspects of contemporary everyday social media practices. Yet, these practices, deeply intertwined with the politics of gender representation, are often dismissed as trivial. Following a feminist media studies approach, grounded in the tradition of cultural studies, this research seeks to provide a critical and qualitative exploration of how young women using Instagram understand gendered self-representational practices. To do so, we conducted 13 in-depth interviews with ‘ordinary’ female Instagram users (i.e., not celebrities, influencers, or ‘Insta-famous’ users) aged 18–35 years. Our findings illustrate how these understandings are rooted in complex negotiations and can combine contradictory discourses. They emphasize the importance of attentive curation in self-representational practices, acknowledging the influence of social and aesthetic conventions of photographable and Instagrammable. These findings highlight the tensions surrounding the idea of self-representation, acknowledging its potential as an empowering practice, while simultaneously recognizing the users’ need to negotiate the culturally prevalent negative and gendered stereotypes about selfie-taking. Furthermore, it also explores the existing negotiations between the desires to engage with popular Instagrammable aesthetics, while still grounding these practices on a sense of authenticity. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The estimated prevalence of this condition is about 12% of the general population and approximately 20% of women under the age of 19. Many women who live with PVD suffer in silence for years before receiving a diagnosis. Whereas cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was already known to be effective for managing symptoms of PVD, there has recently been a published head-to-head comparison of CBT versus mindfulness-based therapy for the primary outcome of pain intensity with penetration. The trial revealed that both treatments were effective and led to statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in sexual function, quality of life, and reduced genital pain, with improvements retained at both 6- and 12-month follow-ups. We then undertook an end-of-grant knowledge translation (KT) campaign focused on the use of social media to disseminate an infographic video depicting the findings. Social media was strategically chosen as the primary mode of dissemination for the video as it has broad reach of audience, the public can access information on social media for free, and it presented an opportunity to provide social support to the population of women with PVD who are characterized as suffering in silence by starting a sensitive and empowering dialogue on a public platform.

In recent times we have seen this flat hierarchical approach fade as commercial stakeholders, platform providers and content publishers continue to design and practice exclusionary processes to ensure their work is visible. This current practice limits the capacity for all voices to be heard, prompting the question how can digital activism remain visible in a media-saturated social media environment?

The results indicates that (1) without noise reduction, it is not possible to establish a correlation on individual tweets and their effects on the stock market; (2) it is not possible to establish a correlation between the number of tweets and the volume of companies; (3) the effect of threshold on the accuracy, which has been done and proven in different studies, has also been proven in this study; (4) RBF Kernel SVM method gives better result than other machine learning methods. © 2020 IEEE."

A study by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found that 40% believed that social media is the primary source of misinformation. Some research works have focused on analyzing the misinformed Twitter data using bot detection and fake-URL identification tools. However, these methods require annotated data in advance and high capacity hardware resources to deal with vast amounts of data. To overcome this challenge, we propose an unsupervised framework to detect misinformed content and the users who may be the sources of or susceptible to spreading misinformed content. This research work leverages the popularity of the tweets in form of re-posts to identify the influential content on the social media. A long w ith textual information, the credibility of the original posters of the popular tweets is assessed by using four primary credible sources i.e., News, Medical Organization, Medical Influencers, a nd Verified users. These categories are dynamically updated by using the semantic similar textual information from the user-descriptions of these user categories. The framework has been tested on two public annotated datasets from FakeNewsNet and has been compared with the baseline classification, clustering, and hybrid models for misinformation detection. Due to the unavailability of the annotated Twitter data, the resulting suspected misinformed users were searched manually on Twitter, where approximately 50% of identified users were a lready suspended. The content of misinformed clusters was validated by performing an emotional analysis of the tweets. This showed that the suspected misinformed clusters contained a high affinity towards anger and fear-inducing tweets. Furthermore, we analyzed the temporal change in geo-graphical tweet densities for all the user-categories and the popular user-interactions in the whole data. © 2020 IEEE."

An estimated 2.95 billion people in 2019 used social media worldwide. The widespread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 resulted with a tsunami of social media. Most platforms were used to transmit relevant news, guidelines and precautions to people. According to WHO, uncontrolled conspiracy theories and propaganda are spreading faster than the COVID-19 pandemic itself, creating an infodemic and thus causing psychological panic, misleading medical advises, and economic disruption. Accordingly, discussions have been initiated with the objective of moderating all COVID-19's communications, except those initiated from trusted sources such as the WHO and authorized governmental entities. This article presents a large-scale study based on data mined from Twitter. Extensive analysis has been performed on approximately one million COVID-19 related tweets collected over a period of two months. Furthermore, the profiles of 288,000 users were analyzed including unique users' profiles, meta-data and tweets' context. The study noted various interesting conclusions including the critical impact in term of reach level of the (1) exploitation of the COVID-19 crisis to redirect readers to irrelevant topics and (2) widespread of unauthentic medical precautions and information. Further data analysis revealed the importance of using social networks in a global pandemic crisis by relying on credible users with variety of occupations, content developers and influencers in specific fields.

He does this by examining a range of promotional uses of the moving image by the fashion industry – by brands such as Gucci, Burberry and Louis Vuitton – on the social media platforms Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat, which blend design with media. This article seeks to engage critically with the branded dominance of ‘fashion film’ as a commercial phenomenon in contemporary visual culture by positioning it as a shape-shifting form of ‘content’ through the dissemination of moving images on social media, on mobile image-sharing platforms, in which the visual dynamic of the feed (of marketing and data) is now, in part, superseding the aesthetic framework of cinema (of narrative and drama). Rather than situating it primarily as part of film history, here the author situates the contemporary fashion-moving image at the intersection of digital interactivity, fashion branding and celebrity influence. © The Author(s), 2020."

SMI were included if they had a blue-tick verification on ≥2 social media (SM) and an active WM blog. A sample of blog posts were systematically evaluated against thirteen credibility indicators under four themes: ‘transparency’, ‘use of other resources’, ‘trustworthiness and adherence to nutritional criteria’ and ‘bias’. Indicators were yes/no questions to determine an overall credibility percentage for each SMI.

Indeed, the profession's rapid adoption of SMIs as part of their campaigns raises questions regarding the ethics of their use and the extent to which they fit with normative models of public relations practice that promote genuine dialogue and responsible advocacy. This study explores this tension between the uses and potential misuses of SMIs by examining the worldviews, strategies and practices of senior public relations practitioners at several agencies in Sydney, Australia. It proposes a new critical framework for understanding the influences that SMIs are in fact having on public relations practice, which builds on models of dialogic public relations and a critical eco-systems perspective. Ultimately, this study argues that the affordances provided by the emergence of SMIs are predisposing practitioners to persuasive strategies and covert activities that lack transparency and are inconsistent with ethical ideals of best practice for organizational public relations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

It was found that exposure to bare-chested and muscular images resulted in significantly lower body satisfaction relative to viewing clothed fashion images or scenery images, which did not differ from each other. The clothed and bare-chested conditions did not differ in amount of appearance-based social comparison, nor in reported inspiration to exercise or eat healthily.

Given an abundance of micro influencers to choose from, cues that help distinguish more versus less effective influencers on social media are of increasing interest to marketers. The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a social media user’s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets).

Through a quantitative and qualitative analysis of digital platforms, discourses and personas, we investigate the ways a key set of digital food influencers (DFIs) construct, curate and share the meanings of good food. We first explore who these influencers are, describe what platforms they inhabit, how the variable social media affordances work through these platforms and the notions of good food they construct. We then focus specifically on DFIs’ communicative practices on Twitter to analyse the core discourses DFIs produce and those that are taken up by audiences through re-tweets and likes as well as the re-tweeted tweets of DFIs. Overall, our findings suggest that first, good food grammars are being constructed by rule setters beyond the already well-established food personalities and celebrity chefs of the UK's foodscape. Yet, these grammars also re-inscribe a form of white, hetero-normative middle- and upper- class privilege that produces particular grammars of good food. Second, different social media and digital platforms provide space for diverse good food grammars given their variable affordances. Twitter, in particular, is the place where the grammars of DFIs take on non-food themes such as self-empowerment, inspiration, charity campaigning and awareness raising. Third, the notions of good food in DFI grammars revolve around a range of constructions, with the most elevated related to ‘clean’ eating and/or ‘clean’ lifestyles that combined healthy, ‘free from’ diets with fitness regimes and expand DFI grammars – and ultimately their brands – into a more holistic lifestyle brand.

The research analyzed the reasoning of Fikih Kebencanaan and its actualization in Covid-19 mitigation, the medical health movement and the reconstruction of fiqh of worship during an emergency in particular, and how to deal with the disaster theologically in general. The results showed that the reasoning of Fikih Kebencanaan was expanded in terms of medical, theological, and educational movements. Medical movement is a health movement in the form of providing 74 Covid-19 Standby Hospitals capable of accommodating 3917 patients or 36.15% of the total number of cases in Indonesia, followed by the distribution of masks, gloves, and foods to 401,209 Covid-19 affected victims. The theological movement was in the form of religious provision in which Muhammadiyah attempted to reconstruct classical Islamic jurisprudence of the rule of worship to adapt to an emergency. In contrast, the Indonesian Council of Ulema (MUI) applied zoning. The educative movement was a preventive effort to counter narration stemming from micro-celebrity Da'i (Islamic preacher) & Influencers (religious preachers) tried to circumvent religious provisions with their viral statements on social media. This effort was realized by developing neuroscience Islamic education with learning media in visualization that combined modern comics and contemporary cartoons with cinematic narratives.

The term “non-boundary” refers to a nonlinear boundary or distinction based on the more flexible time and space in the digital era, rather than a space at a certain time. Based on a theoretical review of media ecology, that is, how the media environment transforms human experience and affects society and culture, the spatial and temporal aspects of digital platforms were characterized as transcendental, open social, realistic virtual, and aesthetic spaces in everyday lives. The fashion-related images from the Instagram account of global fashion influencer Susanna Lau (@susiebubble), uploaded from May 2012–June 2019, were then analyzed, including their titles, caption content, hashtags, and followers’ commentary. Analysis showed that the images represent a digital lifestyle and trace the non-boundaries of style across the binaries of work–leisure, public–private, real–virtual, and geography–culture. © 2020, The Author(s)."

As such, exposure to unhealthy food marketing is a widely acknowledged risk factor contributing to the development of overweight and obesity. Less is known about the effects of healthy food promotion on people’s dietary behavior. This narrative review describes research from the past 5 years focused on the effects of healthy food marketing on children’s and adults’ food preferences and dietary intake. Our aim is to gain insight into the potential effects and mechanistic underpinnings of healthy food promotion, thereby building on existing knowledge on underlying mechanisms of the effectiveness of unhealthy food marketing. Recent Findings: Only a small number of studies directly examined the effects of healthy food promotion on children’s and adults’ dietary behavior. Most studies targeted children’s fruit and/or vegetable intake and used a variety of marketing techniques, ranging from television adverts to social media influencer marketing. Six out of ten studies found a positive effect of healthy food promotion, indicating that healthy food marketing has the potential to influence dietary behavior. Summary: Food marketing is highly effective in stimulating and reinforcing food consumption, in particular for energy-dense foods. Further investigation and experimentation into the efficiency and effectiveness of healthy food promotion are needed to determine how marketing techniques could be used to improve dietary behavior. The healthy food promotion model provides a framework for future research in this area. © 2020, The Author(s)."

Echo chambers and influencers are often deemed responsible of both the polarization of users in online social networks and the success of propaganda and disinformation campaigns. This article adopts a data-driven approach to investigate the structuration of communities and propaganda networks on Twitter in order to assess the correctness of these imputations. In particular, the work aims at characterizing networks of propaganda extracted from a Twitter dataset by combining the information gained by three different classification approaches, focused respectively on (i) using Tweets content to infer the “polarization” of users around a specific topic, (ii) identifying users having an active role in the diffusion of different propaganda and disinformation items, and (iii) analyzing social ties to identify topological clusters and users playing a “central” role in the network. The work identifies highly partisan community structures along political alignments; furthermore, centrality metrics proved to be very informative to detect the most active users in the network and to distinguish users playing different roles; finally, polarization and clustering structure of the retweet graphs provided useful insights about relevant properties of users exposure, interactions, and participation to different propaganda items. © 2020, The Author(s)."

The mixed-method exploits the power of social network analysis to determine a small but prominent group of influencers that provides a manageable dataset for the qualitative review of the content. This paper reviews research on social influence and identifies two local influence theories, “indegree” and “retweet”, ideal for topical discussion.

First outlining the game and its development, we then trace its reception in Chinese and Western social media and its popularity among Chinese players. Combining comparative media and digital ethnographic methodologies, we explore the role of Internet influencers and investigate North Asian cultural commonalities such as Buddhist Zen philosophy, work ethic, and family values examining how they may have contributed to the popularity of the game. Recognizing the cultural appeal of this game outside its native language, we call for an interrogation of the process of games localization as a factor in the success of videogames.

First, the article applies cultural intermediation to celebrity, social media influencers and algorithms to highlight how media is produced and distributed by new forms of intermediation. This section outlines the new players in social media, how the value of media content is transferred from one stakeholder group to another and how algorithms increasingly place prominence on particular types of content.

Social media has fundamentally changed the way we communicate, collaborate, consume, and create content. The ease with which content can be shared has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of individuals or organisations that seek to influence opinion and the volume of content that they generate. The nutrition and diet domain is not immune to this phenomenon. Unfortunately, from a public health perspective, many of these ‘influencers’ may be poorly qualified in order to provide nutritional or dietary guidance, and advice given may be without accepted scientific evidence and contrary to public health policy. In this preliminary study, we analyse the ‘healthy diet’ discourse on Twitter. While using a multi-component analytical approach, we analyse more than 1.2 million English language tweets over a 16-month period in order to identify and characterise the influential actors and discover topics of interest in the discourse. Our analysis suggests that the discourse is dominated by non-health professionals. There is widespread use of bots that pollute the discourse and seek to create a false equivalence on the efficacy of a particular nutritional strategy or diet. Topic modelling suggests a significant focus on diet, nutrition, exercise, weight, disease, and quality of life. Public health policy makers and professional nutritionists need to consider what interventions can be taken in order to counteract the influence of non-professional and bad actors on social media. © 2020 by the authors.

Identifying which users have the power to influence the choices of other users is a significant research topic because it provides an opportunity for companies to identify influential users. However, most current methods to influencers find out by relying on measures of centrality computed on networks that use different kinds of interrelationships to link users. Popular users which have a large number of followers are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning mentions or retweets. A small proportion of all users are called the influencer set. Where these influencers have a big active audience that doubles the content and consumes published. For that reason, an influencer's post whether it is links or text is spread in the social network and draws the attention of a big number of individuals although they may not be direct followers to the influencer. The greater the spread of the post, the user impact is rise.

As Instagram posts featuring left cheek poses gain more ""likes""than right cheek poses, advertisers and social media influencers would likely benefit from favoring the left cheek. While previous investigations of posing biases in print advertising present a conflicting picture, research has yet to investigate posing biases in Instagram advertisements. Given that left cheek images garner more ""likes""than right cheek images, we hypothesized a left cheek bias for Instagram advertisements. Two thousand posts (F = M) were sourced by searching Instagram's ""Most Recent""feed using the #ad, and coded for pose orientation, image type, and model gender. As predicted, Instagram advertisements showed a left cheek bias (59.8 percent) that was evident across genders and image types, being stronger for female than male models, and for full body than head and torso poses. As such, these data indicate that the left cheek bias that characterizes painted and photographic portraits extends to paid Instagram promotions. The difference in bias from previous investigations of posing orientation in print media advertisements may reflect the importance of emotion in driving attentional capture in social media's highly competitive and content-overloaded landscape. © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers."

METHODS: Researchers used Socialbakers data to identify the 5 most-watched kid influencers (ages 3 to 14 years) on YouTube in 2019. We searched for 50 of their most-watched videos and 50 of their videos that featured food and/or drinks on the thumbnail image of the video. We coded whether kid influencers consumed or played with food or toys, quantified the number of minutes food and/or drinks appeared, and recorded names of branded food and/or drinks. We assessed the nutritional quality of foods using the Nutrient Profile Model and identified the number of drinks with added sugar. RESULTS: A sample of 418 YouTube videos met the search criteria, and 179 of those videos featured food and/or drinks. Food and/or drinks were featured in those videos 291 times. Kid influencers’ YouTube videos were collectively viewed .48 billion times, and videos featuring food and/or drinks were viewed 1 billion times.

Objectives: To investigate the needs and priorities of people with spinal cord injury for managing neurogenic bladder and bowel function and to determine their willingness to adopt neuromodulation interventions for these functions. Methods: Anonymous online survey. It was advertised by word-of-mouth by community influencers and social media, and by advertisement in newsletters of advocacy groups. Results: Responses from 370 individuals (27% female, 73% male) were included. Bladder emptying without catheters was the top priority for restoring bladder function, and maintaining fecal continence was the top priority for restoring bowel function. The biggest concerns regarding external stimulation systems were wearing a device with wires connecting to electrodes on the skin and having to don and doff the system daily as needed. The biggest concerns for implanted systems were the chances of experiencing problems with the implant that required a revision surgery or surgical removal of the whole system. Respondents were willing to accept an external (61%) or implanted (41%) device to achieve improved bladder or bowel function. Conclusions: Bladder and bowel dysfunction remain important unmet challenges for individuals living with SCI who answered our survey. These individuals are willing to accept some potential risks of nerve stimulation approaches given potential benefits. Additional consumer input is critical for guiding both research and translation to clinical use and personalized medicine. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply."

Brands partner with Influencers to garner engagement from their target consumers in a new marketing strategy known as “Influencer marketing.” Nonetheless, the theoretical underpinnings of such remains unknown. We suggest a new conceptual framework of “Visual-Congruence-induced Social Influence (VCSI),” which contextualizes the Similarity-Attraction Model in the Social Influence literature. Using VCSI, we delineate how Influencers use visual congruence as representations of shared interests in a specific area to build strong bonds with Followers. This intimate affiliation catalyzes (i.e., mediates) the positive effects of visual congruence on Followers’ brand engagement. To test these hypotheses, we conducted in vivo observations of Influencer marketing on Instagram. We collected >45,000 images and social media usage behaviors over 26 months. We then applied deep-learning algorithms to automatically classify each image and used social media analytics to disclose hidden associations between visual elements and brand engagement. Our hypothesis testing results provide empirical support for VCSI, advancing theories into the rapidly growing fields of multimodal content and Influencer marketing. © 2020"

The proposed framework argues that advertising disclosure has a significant impact on source credibility subdimensions of attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise; subdimensions that positively influence consumer purchase intention. Empirical findings based on 306 German Instagram users between 18 and 34 years of age reveal that source attractiveness, source trustworthiness and source expertise significantly increase consumer purchase intention; whilst advertising disclosure indirectly influences consumer purchase intention by influencing source attractiveness. Furthermore, the results reveal that the number of followers positively influences source attractiveness, source trustworthiness as well as purchase intention.

Compared with social media celebrities, domain-specific influencers are less expensive to hire and more engaged in spreading messages such as new treatment or timely prevention for HIV. However, most of the existing topic modeling based approaches fail to identify influencers who are dedicated to the rare yet important topics such as HIV and suicide. To alleviate this limitation, we investigate an on-Demand Influencer Discovery (DID) framework that is able to identify influencers on any subject depicted by a few user-specified keywords, regardless of its popularity on social media. The DID model employs an iterative learning process that integrates the language attention network as a subject filter and the influence convolution network built on user interactions. Comprehensive evaluations on Twitter datasets show that the DID model can reliably identify influencers even on rare subjects such as HIV and suicide, outperforming existing topic-specific influencer detection models. © 2020 Owner/Author."

One of these strategies is influencer marketing. In the last years, brands have used social media influencers as endorsers of their products and services, and as brand ambassadors.

Their entertaining, or educational-cumentertaining projects located in the gray area between politics and counterculture strive to undermine domineering political discourses (liberal, neo-Soviet, leftist, official patriotic and old nationalist) and to go beyond the left-right dichotomy. The author concludes that the main function of stiob and other forms of irony for the new nationalists is negative identification. Ambivalence of the language of stiob simultaneously attracts the target audience of nationalists (""those in the know"") and does not prevent solidarizing with any political platform when needed.

The purpose of EE serials on radio, television or the internet is to introduce new ideas, norms and practices by means of storytelling, as well as to offer points of engagement for audiences to talk about the themes raised by the intervention. However, in today's media landscape, it has become increasingly difficult to captivate audiences as they have fragmented across channels and have started to create and circulate content themselves. The concept of spreadable media allows us to deal with fragmentation and user-generated content in productive ways, as it recognizes the role of autonomous audience members in shaping the flows of media content in the online networks that underlie today's media landscape. In this article, we introduce spreadable EE: An innovative approach that builds on transmedia storytelling strategies to reach and captivate target audiences for a longer period of time, and that entails collaboration with online platforms, communities and social influencers to stimulate meaningful conversations.

Our aim was to better understand the dynamics underlying the interactions on social media on such a delicate and divisive topic, which are the actors that are leading the discussion, and whose messages have the highest chance to reach out the majority of the accounts that are following the debate. The debate on Twitter is represented with networks; we provide a characterisation of the main clusters by looking at the highest in-degree nodes in each one and by analysing the text of the tweets of all the users. We find a strongly segregated network which shows an explicit interplay with the Italian political and social landscape, that however seems to be disconnected from the actual geographical distribution and relocation of migrants. In addition, quite surprisingly, the influencers and political leaders that apparently lead the debate, do not necessarily belong to the clusters that include the majority of nodes: we find evidence of the existence of a ‘silent majority’ that is more connected to accounts who expose a more positive stance toward migrants, while leaders whose stance is negative attract apparently more attention. Finally, we see that the community structure clearly affects the diffusion of content (URLs) by identifying the presence of both local and global trends of diffusion, and that communities tend to display segregation regardless of their political and cultural background. In particular, we observe that messages that spread widely in the two largest clusters, whose most popular members are also notoriously at the opposite sides of the political spectrum, have a very low chance to get visibility into other clusters. © 2020 by the authors.

African Americans and Hispanics have significantly lower vaccination rates, and large-scale campaigns have had difficulty increasing vaccination among these two groups. This study assessed the feasibility of delivering a flu vaccination promotion campaign using influencers, and examined shifts in social norms regarding flu vaccine acceptability after a social media micro influencer campaign. Influencers were asked to choose from vetted messages and create their own original content promoting flu vaccination, which was posted to their social media pages. Content was intentionally unbranded to ensure that it aligned with the look and feel of their pages. Cross-sectional pre- and post-campaign surveys were conducted within regions that received the campaign and control regions to examine potential campaign impact. Digital metrics assessed campaign exposure. Overall, 117 influencers generated 69,495 engagements. Results from the region that received the campaign showed significant increases in positive beliefs about the flu vaccine, and significant decreases in negative community attitudes toward the vaccine. This study suggests that flu campaigns using a ground-up rather than top-down approach can feasibly reach at-risk groups with lower vaccination rates, and shows the potentials of using an influencer-based model to communicate information about flu vaccination on a large scale. 2020 Bonnevie et al.

A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are “empty.” Research has shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice about social distancing and other public health interventions. Due to the possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an understanding of the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it. Objective: This study set out to evaluate the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which online sources of information were used as evidence to support the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a conspiracy theory in the future. Methods: Twitter data related to the #FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify accounts with a higher probability of being bots. Results: The most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on the platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and deleted accounts within the network. Conclusions: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can be targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing misinformation. Social media organizations need to bolster their efforts to label or remove content that contains misinformation. Public health authorities could enlist the assistance of influencers in spreading antinarrative content. © Wasim Ahmed, Francesc López Seguí, Josep Vidal-Alaball, Matthew S Katz."

MSIs have a social presence and are perceived as a credible source of healthrelated information. A research gap, however, exists in understanding the communication strategies employed by MSIs and the factors driving the public to engage in health communication with MSIs. This study, therefore, developed a new conceptual framework incorporating health communication, dialogic and interpersonal communication by employing quantitative content analysis to examine public engagement with MSI communication on the largest microblogging site in China, Sina Weibo. The analysis yielded insights into how the usefulness of health-related information provided alongside the interactive dialogue and affective practices played an active role in engaging the public. The public sought healthrelated information primarily to address issues of concern for well-being and a high level of engagement in terms of online shares, likes, and comments was found. The use of multimedia made the site more appealing, resulting in likes while the expression of emotions by MSIs generated likes and comments. The need to connect with other online users and have a sense of community was reflected in engagement through sharing useful MSI posts by the public. By identifying influential MSIs on social networking sites, health information providers such as organizations and the government can raise awareness of health issues to foster a healthy lifestyle and contribute to better living in the community. © 2020 Ngai et al.

Fashion clothing is massively consumed, and consumer habits are deeply affected by online advertising. These consumption practices are not simply passive, sometimes they are creative, yet they are still part of the fashion disciplinary device. In these consumption practices, a range of expressions and discourses between individuals may be detected as well as multiple subjectivities under construction within contemporary societies. The intention of this article is to shed some light on the role of online fashion consumption practices within our societies, which are traversed by daily and prevailingly online advertising and encourage increased consumption. ‘Influencers’ are one novel example of how online advertising is subtly influencing fashion consumption. Even though consumers show certain tendencies in acquiring fashion clothing from specific brands, via different digital media outlets depending on their socioeconomic status and their peer groups, their consumption practices may try to subvert the conventional formats through which fashion clothing has been consumed traditionally. Nevertheless, as much as these practices seem to promote freedom, they might confirm the tactics of the system and just be a part of the algorithmic logic that imposes certain products, reproducing established categories. © 2020 Intellect Ltd Article.

The term itself is ubiquitous in management, but remains undefined from a holistic point of view and is understudied in the academic literature. We thus address this gap and complement previous conceptualizations with empirical research on lifestyle fashion branding. The study herein relies on seven semi-structured, in-depth interviews with experienced Spanish fashion brand consultants who advise prestigious fashion companies in Spain. The interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and Atlas.ti 7.5.18 software, employing an interpretive, qualitative approach. This paper’s primary contribution is found in its empirical study of lifestyle branding conceptualizations from fashion professionals with diverse fashion expertise, including in digital branding, lifestyle retailing, strategic communications, public relations, influencer marketing and social media. Insights into lifestyle branding conceptualizations in relation to fashion retailing emerge from their combined expertise, which then further point to opportunities for expanded research on lifestyle branding in a variety of fashion retail contexts. © 2020 Korean Scholars of Marketing Science."

Large-scale campaigns for evidence dissemination and promotion through targeted interventions on social media may help overcome some of these barriers. To date, most breastfeeding research on social media only focuses on content analysis, and there remains limited knowledge about the social networks of online communities (who interacts with whom), influencers in the breastfeeding space and the diffusion of evidence-based knowledge. This study, grounded in social network theory, aims to better understand the breastfeeding communication landscape on Twitter including determining the presence of a breastfeeding network, communities and key influencers. Further, we characterize influencer interactions, roles and the content being shared. The study revealed an overall breastfeeding social network of 3,798 unique individuals (users) and 3,972 tweets with commonly used hashtags (e.g., #breastfeeding and #normalizebreastfeeding). Around one third of users (n = 1,324, 34%) exchanged pornographic content (PC) that sexualized breastfeeding. The non-PC network (n = 2,474 users) formed 144 unique communities, and content flowing within the network was disproportionately influenced by 59 key influencers. However, these influencers had mostly inward-oriented interaction (% composition, E-I index: 47% professionals, −0.18; 41% interested citizens, −0.67; 12% companies, −0.18), limiting opportunities for evidence-based dissemination to the lay public. Although more tweets about peer-reviewed research findings were sent compared with tweets about nonevidence-based lay recommendations, our findings suggest that it is the lay public who often communicated findings, which may be overcome through a targeted social network-based intervention. © 2020 The Authors.

The DISCERN criterion for assessing consumer health information was used to evaluate each video. A score of 1 indicates a low overall video quality, whereas a 5 indicates a high-quality source of information for patients. The DISCERN treatment assessment is a validated tool to assess the quality of patient information about treatment choices. Two-sample t tests and Mann–Whitney U tests were used to determine significance. Results: We analyzed 90 videos receiving a total of 108,240,496 views with a mean view count of 1,202,672 views per video (Table 1). Pharmaceuticals including minoxidil and finasteride were the most commonly mentioned treatment (30% of videos) followed by nutraceuticals (20%). YouTube influencers (Table 2) represented 37.8% of authors followed by companies/advertisers (15.6%). Seventeen videos (18.9%) included board-certified dermatologists. The mean DS overall was 2.66, and the mean DS for bias was 2.98. Discussion: Our data demonstrate the extensive use of YouTube for hair loss treatment information. While YouTube can be a valuable resource for patients, videos are often biased and can misinform patients. Moreover, the lack of a central review process or governing body to validate claims made in videos can be a safety concern.

Although existing evidence suggests that influencers have largely positive effects on brands, there is paucity of research on the role of influencers in corporate crisis communications. Across two studies, we examine the impact of influencers on consumers’ perception of corporate brands responding to crises. Drawing on persuasion knowledge theory, we identify issues associated with brands engaging influencers, such as inference of manipulative intent, which negatively affects perceived trustworthiness and corporate reputation. The downside of employing influencers in crisis communications is, however, offset by the influencer and brand communicating values-driven motives of their partnership. Our findings imply that corporate brands should respond to crises through a bolstering strategy promoting existing corporate goodwill, without the influencer's involvement. When leveraging influencers’ support, however, brands should endeavor to inoculate against manipulative inferences by communicating values-driven motives behind the brand-influencer partnership. © 2020"

Vancouver Island, BC, with 0.3% of the total area of Canada, has the world's highest density of cougars, while mainland BC has about 25% of the world's population of brown or grizzly bears, and between 120 and 150 thousand black bears, out of the North American total of between 850,00 and 900,000. The human population of BC is rapidly increasing, through high birth and immigration rates from international sources and other parts of Canada, the result of a generally strong economy. Intensified and expanded human landuse and increased predator populations have contributed to human/animal conflicts, including physical attacks and predation on people and companion animals/livestock, nuisance intrusion by large predators into valued human life spaces and landscapes, and human political conflicts defined by different, opposed social attitude groups and influencers. This chapter examines recent literature on the environmental and social networks that surround these animal/human dynamics, and some recent methodologies for the study of these dynamics. Published findings indicate that spatial counter-intrusions of people and large predators into each other's habitats are increasing, both in areas of dense urban substrates and comparatively remote primal habitats. Research methodologies are also changing, with increasing use of social media, drones, global positioning systems and qualitative cultural value studies. Long term trends may be towards greater tolerance among variable social groups of animal intrusions into human life spaces, greater animal adaptation to human-modified landscapes and a redefinition of 'conflicts' as 'interactions', with a 'shared rights' perspective superseding a 'dangerous wildlife' view. However, the adaptive individualism and variable intra-species animal behavior, the variability of perspectives across generational and gendered social strata, and the rapidity of multidirectional environmental change precludes definitive judgements for the near future. This review of critical findings in current research, including discerned trends, makes an important contribution to conservation biology, environmental and conservation psychology, environmental planning, the sociology of environmental change and Canadian studies. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It suggests influencer interactivity as a unique feature of influencer brands and investigates how it affects influencer authenticity, emotional attachment, and thus brand loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey of 282 social media users was conducted to estimate the conceptual model. Participants were asked to respond to the survey questions based on their perceptions of a specific influencer they follow on social media. The relationships among variables were tested via structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings show that influencer interactivity is positively related to influencer authenticity and emotional attachment. Influencer authenticity mediates the effect of interactivity on emotional attachment and directly affects brand trust. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that followers’ emotional attachment to influencer brands increases brand loyalty through brand trust. Originality/value: This study is the first to approach influencers as a brand, rather than a brand endorser. Specifically, this study conceptualizes the influencer brand’s interactivity and finds a link between influencer interactivity and the followers’ perception of influencer authenticity. It discusses why influencer interactivity and authenticity play key roles in shaping influencer brand equity. This study contributes to both the human brands and the influencer marketing literature by proposing a model to understand how the brand equity of the influencer brand is formed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted to explore social media influencers. Qualitative content analysis and modeling with path analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings: Results found attractiveness and likeability to positively predict attitudes toward the influencer, word-of-mouth and purchase intentions, whereas similarity only predicted word-of-mouth from the follower. Closeness served as a moderator but had different effects. Closeness positively moderated the effect of attractiveness on purchase intentions; however, it had a negative effect with similarity on purchase intentions. Moreover, closeness moderated the effect of likeability on attitude toward the influencer.

For the description of these different market relations, this article introduces the notion of arity into the scientific discussion. On unary information markets, customers pay with their money; examples include commercial information suppliers. Binary information markets are characterized by one market side paying with attention (e.g., on the search engine Google) or with personal data (e.g., on most social media services) and the other market side (mainly advertisers) paying with money. Our example of a ternary market is a social media market with the additional market side of influencers. If customers buy on unary markets, they know what to pay (in terms of money). If they pay with attention or with their personal data, they do not know what they have to pay exactly in the end. On n-ary markets (n greater than 1), laws should regulate company's abuse of money and―which is new―abuse of data streams with the aid of competition (or anti-trust) laws, and by modified data protection laws, which are guided by fair use of end users’ attention and data. © 2020.

However, little is currently known about the propagation pattern of wildlife-related information on social media. In this study, a quantitative model was developed based on 230 independent cetacean stranding incidents (2008-2018) across mainland China from a popular Chinese social media platform (Sina Weibo). This model enabled analysis of the post formation process, identification of the key factors influencing the popularity of the posts and wildlife-related incidents, and allowed investigation of public opinions. The results showed that central media users can increase the overall possibility of elevating incident popularity by ∼75 times, an attractive species or incident by ∼5 times, and a negative social ethics incident by ∼3 times. Traditional media users and celebrity influencers performed key roles in affecting the level of re-posting. Online audiences of highly popular posts predominantly encompassed both users from relatively developed regions and female users. It was observed that posts which became popular within ∼12 h retained their influence for ∼3 d. Post popularity was closely related to comment counts rather than forwarding in the first day of posting and the whole status retention time. Public opinion generally expressed a supportive attitude towards wildlife conservation, but lacked in-depth thinking, and individual responsibility was expressed through revival incidents. In order to raise public awareness towards biodiversity conservation, social media-based wildlife information dissemination should balance the content of attractive and non-charismatic species or incidents and include more positive emotions. Posts via traditional users (especially central media users) and opinion leaders (celebrities) can attract a highly educated audience and females, and thus evoke increased comment numbers during the first day of posting. This will help to popularise conservation knowledge and legislation with continuous efforts. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd."

This paper focuses on the unique role of Chinese diaspora vloggers during an unprecedented global event - the COVID-19 pandemic. Using manual keyword search (e.g., zhaijia riji, faguo yiqing) and chance sampling (i.e., following platform recommendation), we collected 26 videos (07:44:30) from six Chinese YouTube micro-influencers (1-100k followers) located in Germany, the US, Australia, France, Italy, and Korea. Drawing on theories of narrative and stance-taking, we analyzed how these diaspora vloggers relate their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that vloggers display both universal (e.g., fears) and culturally specific (e.g., mask-wearing) feelings, and invite their viewers to co-construe the emotional experience (e.g., the pronoun ni and address term dajia). Moreover, through different ways of ""being Chinese"", vloggers orient their discourse to a unique audience - transnational Chinese-speaking diaspora.

With the profound growth of video marketing on social platforms, brands have increasingly leveraged vloggers to promote female-targeted products. This phenomenon becomes especially paradoxical when marketers bring the narrative of female empowerment into the discourse. This case study employed textual analysis to understand how Chinese viewers make sense of Bobbi Brown’s “The Big Women” vlog endorsed by the female vlogger Zhuzi on Weibo. A typology of viewers’ response was generated: (1) reciprocity of self-disclosure; (2) perceived interconnectedness with the vlogger; and (3) perceived women empowerment and advertisement effectiveness. The findings of this article articulate a symbolic form of relationship between content creators, brands, and consumers that promotes women empowerment. This study argues, however, that this perception of women empowerment may obscure the implicit consumerism embedded in the femvertising contents, while promoting the myth of self-empowerment through consumption. The findings of the study shed light on the rise of (pseudo-)feminism ethos constructed by the consumer market in contemporary China and beyond. © The Author(s) 2020."

Our findings suggest that the Brexit discourse on Twitter can be largely explained by calculated publics organized around the two campaigns and political parties. Ad hoc communities were identified based on (i) the media, (ii) geo-location, and (iii) the US presidential election.

Yet, very few studies have investigated the impact of incorrect information on individual and collective decisions. We performed experiments in which participants had to estimate a series of quantities, before and after receiving social information. Unbeknownst to them, we controlled the degree of inaccuracy of the social information through 'virtual influencers', who provided some incorrect information. We find that a large proportion of individuals only partially follow the social information, thus resisting incorrect information. Moreover, incorrect information can help improve group performance more than correct information, when going against a human underestimation bias. We then design a computational model whose predictions are in good agreement with the empirical data, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying our results. Besides these main findings, we demonstrate that the dispersion of estimates varies a lot between quantities, and must thus be considered when normalizing and aggregating estimates of quantities that are very different in nature. Overall, our results suggest that incorrect information does not necessarily impair the collective wisdom of groups, and can even be used to dampen the negative effects of known cognitive biases. © 2020 The Author(s)."

The most popular are able to accumulate millions of followers. The marketing potential of fitness influencers is a subject of interest, not only for the fitness industry but also for other sectors offering products related to health, wellness, or healthy nutrition. However, the activities of fitness influencers related to the promotion of physical activity and healthy lifestyle converge with the aims of those promoting public health. The main objective of this study was to make an assessment of the determinants of regular access to fitness influencers’ sites (FIS) and their relationship with the health behaviors of young adult women. It was based on the data originating from an online survey on a representative sample of Polish women aged 18–35 years. Chi2 test, univariate, and multiply logistic regression models were used to determine the relationships between FIS and the variables related to the respondents’ characteristics of and their health behaviors. FIS were accessed by 29.3% of respondents (n = 1030) at least once a week. It was found that those living in cities with a population ranging from 20,000 to 100,000 were more likely to access FIS than those living in rural areas. Similarly, greater access was made by those in a high-income household rather than those with the lowest income, by those with inadequate rather than those with problematic health literacy and by those with high rather than low e-health literacy. The use of FIS was significantly associated with the consumptions of fruit and vegetables (OR, 95%CI: 2.77, 2.01–3.82), physical activity (1.74, 1.27–2.38), breast self-examination (1.54, 1.11–2.13), and also with the greater use of e-cigarettes (1.63, 1.09–2.43) and increased consumption of alcohol (1.37, 1.01–1.88). In conclusion, as access to Internet resources run by fitness influencers was a prevailing predictor of young adult Polish women’s health behaviors, FIS may play a potentially important role in promoting a healthy lifestyle in this population. However, it should be remembered that there are complex patterns of associations with specific behaviors, e.g., the use of e-cigarettes or alcohol consumption. © 2020 by the author.

Understanding popularity helps ordinary users to boost popularity, and business users to choose better influencers. There were studies to predict the popularity of posted images on social media, but there was none on the user's popularity as a whole. Furthermore, existing studies have not taken hashtag analysis into consideration, one of the most useful social media feature. This research aims to create a model to predict a user's popularity, which is defined by a combination of engagement rate and followers growth. There were six machine learning regression models tested. The proposed model successfully predicted the users’ popularity, with R2 up to 0.852, using Random Forest with 10-fold cross-validation. The additional statistical analysis and features analysis results revealed factors that can boost popularity, such as actively posting and following users, completing user's metadata, and using 11 hashtags. In contrast, it was also found that having a large number of posts and following in the past will not help in growing popularity, as well as the use of popular hashtags. © 2020, International Association of Engineers.

Quantitative research on the aesthetic appeal of these advertisements from the adolescent and young adult perspective is lacking. We evaluated (1) how adolescents and young adults perceived tobacco and marijuana messaging online and through social media platforms and (2) interactive behaviors related to these messages. Methods: We interviewed 24 participants from the Tobacco Perceptions Study, a longitudinal study of adolescents’ and young adults’ (aged 17-21) tobacco-related perceptions and tobacco use. We collected qualitative data from October 2017 through February 2018, through individual semi-structured interviews, on participants’ experiences and interactions with online tobacco and marijuana advertisements and the advertisements’ appeal. Two analysts recorded, transcribed, and coded interviews. Results: Themes that emerged from the interviews focused on the direct appeal of online messaging to adolescents and young adults; the value of trusting the source; the role of general attitudes and personal decision-making related to using tobacco and/or marijuana; the appeal of messaging that includes colors, interesting packaging, and appealing flavors; and the preference of messages communicated by young people and influencers rather than by industry. Conclusion: These findings suggest the need for increased regulation of social media messaging and marketing of tobacco and marijuana, with a particular focus on regulating social media, paid influencers, and marketing that appeals to adolescents and young adults. The findings also suggest the importance of prevention programs addressing the role of social media in influencing the use of tobacco and marijuana. © 2020, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health."

Similarly, an online influencer mode is applicable in the architecture field. This study introduces the term “influential online architecture” (IOA) and aims to understand the cause and promotion of the IOA phenomenon and its impact on architecture. This research also introduces Bourdieu's four forms of capital, namely, economic, cultural, social, and symbolic capitals, as a framework to argue that IOA is promoted by capitals through visual spectacles, class divisions, national identity, and social recognition. The methodology of this research uses case studies and logical argumentation through presentation and analysis of photos, statistical data, and comments from journals, books, news, and social platforms. The current study concludes that the online influencer mode in architecture should be concerned because the overemphasis on capitals through the production of IOA may erode the design field. This research argues that a well-established architecture criticism and post-occupancy evaluation system and a rational online influencer mode would contribute to the development of the design domain. © 2020 The Author"

This research aims to identify fake users' behavior and proposes supervised machine learning models to classify authentic and fake users. The dataset contains fake users bought from various sources, and authentic users. There are 17 features used, based on these sources: 6 metadata, 3 media info, 2 engagement, 2 media tags, 4 media similarity Five machine learning algorithms will be tested. Three different approaches of classification are proposed, i.e. classification to 2-classes and 4-classes, and classification with metadata. Random forest algorithm produces the highest accuracy for the 2-classes (authentic, fake) and 4-classes (authentic, active fake user, inactive fake user, spammer) classification, with accuracy up to 91.76%. The result also shows that the five metadata variables, i.e. number of posts, followers, biography length, following, and link availability are the biggest predictors for the users class.

Categorical influencers are important for media marketing but to automatically detect them remains a challenge. Design/methodology/approach: We deployed the emerging deep learning approaches. Precisely, we used word embedding to encode semantic information of words occurring in the common microtext of social media and used variational autoencoder (VAE) to approximate the topic modeling process, through which the active categories of influencers are automatically detected. We developed a system known as Categorical Influencer Detection (CID) to realize those ideas. Findings: The approach of using VAE to simulate the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) process can effectively handle the task of topic modeling on the vast dataset of microtext on social media channels. Research limitations/implications: This work has two major contributions. The first one is the detection of topics on microtexts using deep learning approach. The second is the identification of categorical influencers in social media.

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, the authors propose a conceptual model that combines the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and theoretical outcomes of prior literature related to influencer marketing. Based on data collected from 610 Moroccan respondents, the authors empirically test the conceptual model using a partial least squares (PLS) estimation. Findings: This study illustrates that attitudes toward FIs positively impact brand attitude and consumer purchase intention. The authors also demonstrate that perceived credibility, trust, perceived behavioral control, perceived subjective norms, perceived expertise and perceived congruence positively impact attitudes toward FIs. Practical implications: The study findings help marketers and advertisers in the fashion industry to understand how influencer marketing contributes to consumer purchase intention.

Its digital innovations include hiring social media consultants, “Internet Brigade” and “influencers” to soft-sell public policies and counter anti-establishment online comments. Based on a comparative analysis of four Facebook activities of four key political parties over the last decade, this study finds Facebook use to have raised electoral competitiveness, albeit temporarily.

Hinging on imagery, and led by Pinterest, Instagram, and WeHeartIt, a breed of social media is gaining ground by attracting millennials and females. Accordingly, there is a need to conceptualize social media mavenism in a way that deliberates the specificities of these media and theorize about its liaison with the behaviors related to social commerce and conducted by consumers on these media. In the qualitative investigation, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen regular users of Pinterest, Instagram, Etsy, WeHeartIt or Polyvore. The quantitative investigation consisted of 528 females that are regular users of Pinterest. The results supported our thesis that the social network’s utilitarian attitude, role in decision making, and digital virtual consumption generate the maven-like behavior by fueling three social commerce-related behaviors (network expansion, social privatization, and knowledge creation). Post-hoc analysis reveals that individual factors discriminate social media mavens or influencers, showing predictive validity. The results lay the groundwork for an action-based metric that entice practitioners to target online mavens by discerning the social commerce-related behaviors they conduct–behaviors that can be nurtured by enhancing the network’s attitudinal and experiential factors. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The study demonstrates the sentiment and sharing evolution of tweets, illustrating the value co-destruction of a tourism destination. Overall, the study expands understanding on the online footprints of MWOM in the field of tourism. Design/methodology/approach: It uses social media focused data mining and sentiment analysis, to analyze more than 90,000 tweets posted by top twitter influencers between 2013 and 2015. The methodology that the authors have adopted follows seven steps: first, identification of the top-5 twitter influencers who use the hashtag #Athens, based on their klout score; second, collection of tweets from the top-5 twitter influencers, for the period from January 2013 until June 2015; third, collection of the retweets metadata of the above tweets and of the corresponding retweeter accounts (i.e. user id, name, screen name), together with the frequency of retweeting per tweet; fourth, collection of user metadata (i.e. location and number of followers) from the retweeter accounts; fifth, influence computation of retweetwers using their klout score; sixth, tweets classification based on the klout score of their retweeters; and seventh, sentiment analysis of the collected tweets. Findings: The findings show the high potential of value co-destruction in virtual environments, through negative MWOM related to tourism destinations in crisis, and shared among highly influencing users, that disseminate negative stories through microblogging. The findings also reveal the existence of negativity bias that can reduce the risks of visiting a new destination facing a crisis and, at the same time, significantly destroy the destination’s value.

Design/methodology/approach: An experiment was conducted with 321 participants recruited from MTurk to test a moderated serial-mediation model. Findings: The results indicate that when consumers become cognizant that an influencer’s branded promotional post may have been motivated by an underlying financial relationship, they evaluate the influencer as significantly less transparent if a more ambiguous disclosure is used relative to a clearer disclosure. Transparency perceptions of the influencer impact consumers’ perceptions of product efficacy as well as purchase intentions. Originality/value: Social media influencers are rapidly emerging as a popular marketing tool for brand managers, but consumer response to this form of promotion is not well understood. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to investigate how the type of endorsement disclosure used by a social media influencer impacts consumer perception of influencer transparency, product efficacy and purchase intentions.

As of August 12, 2020, the confirmed number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia reached 130,718. There were 85,798 victims who have recovered and 5,903 who have died. Data show a significant increase in cases of COVID-19 every day. For this reason, there needs to be an evaluation of the government policy of the Republic of Indonesia in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. An evaluation of policies for handling the pandemic must include public opinion to determine any weaknesses of this policy. The development of public opinion about the lockdown policy can be understood through social media. During the COVID-19 pandemic, measuring public opinion through traditional methods (surveys) was difficult. For this reason, we utilized big data on social media as research data. The main purpose of this study is to understand public opinion on the lockdown policy in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The things observed included: volume of Twitter users, top influencers, top tweets, and communication networks between Twitter users. For the methodological development of future public opinion research, the researchers outline the obstacles faced in researching public opinion based on big data from Twitter. The research results show that the lockdown policy is an interesting issue, as evidenced by the number of active users (79,502) forming 133,209 networks. Posts about the lockdown on Twitter continued to increase after the implementation of the lockdown policy on April 10, 2020. The lockdown policy has caused various reactions, seen from the word analysis showing 14.8% positive sentiment, 17.5% negative, and 67.67% non-categorized words. Sources of information who have played the roles of top influencers regarding the lockdown policy include: Jokowi (the president of the Republic of Indonesia), online media, television media, government departments, and governors. Based on the analysis of the network structure, it shows that Jokowi has a central role in controlling the lockdown policy. Several challenges were found in this study: 1) choosing keywords for downloading data, 2) categorizing words containing public opinion sentiment, and 3) determining the sample size. © 2020, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative.

These forums are PTT, SOGO, Ck101, Plurk, Mobile01, TalkFetnet, Gamez, PlaySport, Dcard, Eyny, and PCDVD. The variables that were the best predictors of influencer classification were strong influences, engagements, and hot values across 11 Internet forums. Learning the response to the COVID-19 pandemic is vital because public actions could have been fueled by stigmatizing terms that may harm public health and well-being.

Messages concerning any topic are daily posted. A message posted by a given user reaches all the users that decided to follow her/him. Some users post many messages, because they aim at being recognized as influencers, typically on specific topics. How a user can discover influencers concerned with her/his interest? Micro-blog apps and web sites lack a functionality to recommend users with influencers, on the basis of the content of posted messages. In this paper, we envision such a scenario and we identify the problem that constitutes the basic brick for developing a recommender of (possibly influencer) users: training a classification model by exploiting messages labeled with topical classes, so as this model can be used to classify unlabeled messages, to let the hidden topic they talk about emerge. Specifically, the paper reports the investigation activity we performed to demonstrate the suitability of our idea. To perform the investigation, we developed an investigation framework that exploits various patterns for extracting features from within messages (labeled with topical classes) in conjunction with the mostly-used classifiers for text classification problems. By means of the investigation framework, we were able to perform a large pool of experiments, that allowed us to evaluate all the combinations of feature patterns with classifiers. By means of a cost-benefit function called ""Suitability"", that combines accuracy with execution time, we were able to demonstrate that a technique for discovering topics from within messages suitable for the application context is available. © 2020 by the authors."

These rates may be influenced by limited diffusion of evidence-based research and guidelines from the scientific community (SC). As recently highlighted by the National Academy of Sciences, there is a need for the SC to diffuse its findings to the public more effectively online, as means to counteract the spread of misinformation. In response to this call, we gathered data from Twitter for one month from major breastfeeding hashtags resulting in an interconnected social network (n = 3,798 users). We then identified 59 influencers who disproportionately influenced information flow using social network analysis. These influencers were from the SC (e.g. academics, researchers, health care practitioners), as well as interested citizens (IC) and companies. We then conducted an ego-network analysis of influencer networks, developed ego maps, and compared diffusion metrics across the SC, IC and company influencers. We also qualitatively analyzed their tweets (n = 711) to understand the type of information being diffused. SC influencers were the least efficient communicators. Although having the highest tweeting activity (80% of tweets), they did not reach more individuals compared to IC and companies (two-step ego size: 220± 99, 188 ± 124, 169 ± 97 respectively, P = 0.28). Content analysis of tweets suggest IC are more active than the SC in diffusing evidence-based breastfeeding knowledge, with 35% of their tweets around recent research findings compared to only 12% by the SC. Nonetheless, in terms of outreach to the general public, the two-step networks of SC influences were more heterogenous than ICs (55.7 ± 5.07, 50.9 ± 12.0, respectively, P<0.001). Collectively, these findings suggest SC influencers may possess latent potential to diffuse research and evidence- based practices. However, the research suggests specific ways to enhance diffusion.

This study examines whether or not the source of this sponsored content plays a crucial role in determining advertising effectiveness among adolescents (aged twelve to eighteen years, N = 131). In particular, sponsored content can be endorsed by the brand itself or by a social media influencer who has been compensated to promote the brand on his/her Instagram profile. Adolescents are often not aware that the sponsored influencer post is advertising, which thereby obstructs a critical reflection. Although previous research indicates that adding a proper disclosure can slightly increase users' advertising recognition, it is unclear both how this recognition further affects users’ processing of sponsored content and whether or not this process differs for content posted by brands and content posted by influencers. This study therefore experimentally examines the moderating role of advertising recognition on these source effects. The results reveal that influencer posts lead to higher brand liking, whereas brand posts lead to higher brand awareness. Furthermore, influencers are more greatly admired, whereas brands are perceived as more credible (when advertising recognition is high). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper we investigate how to improve user-to-user recommendation exploiting a user similarity metric computed analysing the photos shared by users on their Instagram profile. We consider in particular users with an established credibility and audience, the so called ""influencers"". The main idea is that if two influencers publish photos containing similar content it is more likely that they share the same interests and are similar. Moreover, users that follow other users sharing related content are also more similar. Similarity between influencers' photo collections is estimated through neural network embeddings, using a network trained to classify photo collections in categories of interest. An hybrid recommendation approach, which combines collaborative filtering and results from this compact representation of visual content of photo collections, is proposed.

We use an approach based on a fixed list of words associated with sponsorship (i.e. links, mentions of brands, use of words like ""sale"") as well as natural language processing to assess the likelihood that a post is sponsored. We show that sponsored content use may have increased after changes in disclosure and that followers may have been negatively affected.

Objective: To determine whether a social media campaign, targeted at the gaps in behavior on personal hygiene and physical distancing and distributed nationwide via digital news media, may be an effective method to improve behavior and help to inhibit person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study was designed to uncover self-reported gaps in behavior regarding personal hygiene and physical distancing in the Netherlands. A diagnostic survey was distributed by a large national newspaper (De Telegraaf) and a popular social influencer (Govert Sweep) on March 17, 2020, and was completed by 16072 participants. Analysis of these outcomes showed that coughing and sneezing in the elbow was done well, but that handwashing, face touching, and physical distancing showed serious gaps compared with advised behavior. This diagnostic information was used to design infographics and a video targeted at repairing these gaps in behavior. The video and infographics were distributed on a national level on March 21, 2020, followed by a postcampaign survey to measure the results on March 24, 2020. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2020. Exposure: Exposed participants were those who viewed the infographics and/or video. Main Outcomes and Measures: Improvement on the extent of handwashing in all areas, handwashing duration of 20 seconds or longer, awareness on face touching, and physical distancing were measured according to responses on the postcampaign survey. Results: A total of 17189 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.61 [13.57] years; 9100 women [52.9%]) responded to the postcampaign survey. The news article in De Telegraaf was read more than 2 million times, and the influencer video was watched more than 80000 times. Cross-sectional analysis of the postcampaign survey using logistic regression correcting for age, gender, and educational level showed that exposure to the video plus infographics (827 participants) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.83-2.50; P <.001) and to the infographics alone (11348 participants) (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.40; P <.001) were positively associated with washing hands in all areas compared with the unexposed group (4751 participants). In addition, exposure to the video plus infographics (adjusted OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.59-2.16; P <.001) and to the infographics alone (adjusted OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.19-1.36; P <.001) were positively associated with washing hands long enough compared with the unexposed group. Exposure to the video alone was not associated with improved handwashing. Compared with the unexposed group, exposure to the infographics alone and video plus infographics were associated with improvements in physical distancing when the participant had COVID-19 syptoms (infographics alone, adjusted OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P =.006; video plus infographics, adjusted OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; P =.001) and face touching (infographics alone, adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.22-1.38; P <.001; infographics and video, adjusted OR, 1.49, 95% CI, 1.30-1.71; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that a targeted behavioral change campaign, promoted by a news platform and social media, was associated with self-reported improvement in personal hygiene with the aim to prevent person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This method of evidence-based campaigning may be an effective way to improve critical public health issues, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.. © 2020 American Medical Association.

The present study explores the effects of self-influencer congruence on brand attitude, brand engagement, and purchase intention in China’s dynamic social media context. The perceived motive of social media influencer’s endorsement behavior, parasocial identification with social media influencers, and their roles in the endorsement process were examined. The results of this study suggest that a high degree of congruence between the image of a social media influencer and the consumer’s ideal self-image leads to effective endorsement outcomes. Parasocial identification was found to mediate the relationship between self-influencer congruence and endorsement outcomes while perceived endorser motive was found to moderate the effects of self-influencer congruence on such outcomes through parasocial identification. © 2019, © 2019 Advertising Association."

This commentary argues that by focusing primarily on the content level we miss the bigger picture where disinformation and infodemics are only symptoms of something more important on a media infrastructure level. The commentary suggests that we need to reconsider regulation on the infrastructure level instead that supports the democratic need for better access to verified content by looking at how the current legal structure across regulatory silos is benefitting the exact opposite. Furthermore, the commentary suggests to specifically address influencers (defined by number of followers) in the context of moderation, and lastly suggests that user data is ideally stored and governed outside privately owned companies in Europe in order to benefit users and society at large. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

For public health agencies, understanding the driving forces of web-based discussions will help deliver more effective and efficient information to general users on social media and the web. Objective: The study aimed to identify the major contributors that drove overall Zika-related tweeting dynamics during the 2016 epidemic. In total, 3 hypothetical drivers were proposed: (1) the underlying Zika epidemic quantified as a time series of case counts; (2) sporadic but critical real-world events such as the 2016 Rio Olympics and World Health Organization’s Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) announcement, and (3) a few influential users’ tweeting activities. Methods: All tweets and retweets (RTs) containing the keyword Zika posted in 2016 were collected via the Gnip application programming interface (API). We developed an analytical pipeline, EventPeriscope, to identify co-occurring trending events with Zika and quantify the strength of these events. We also retrieved Zika case data and identified the top influencers of the Zika discussion on Twitter. The influence of 3 potential drivers was examined via a multivariate time series analysis, signal processing, a content analysis, and text mining techniques. Results: Zika-related tweeting dynamics were not significantly correlated with the underlying Zika epidemic in the United States in any of the four quarters in 2016 nor in the entire year. Instead, peaks of Zika-related tweeting activity were strongly associated with a few critical real-world events, both planned, such as the Rio Olympics, and unplanned, such as the PHEIC announcement. The Rio Olympics was mentioned in >15% of all Zika-related tweets and PHEIC occurred in 27% of Zika-related tweets around their respective peaks. In addition, the overall tweeting dynamics of the top 100 most actively tweeting users on the Zika topic, the top 100 users receiving most RTs, and the top 100 users mentioned were the most highly correlated to and preceded the overall tweeting dynamics, making these groups of users the potential drivers of tweeting dynamics. The top 100 users who retweeted the most were not critical in driving the overall tweeting dynamics. There were very few overlaps among these different groups of potentially influential users. Conclusions: Using our proposed analytical workflow, EventPeriscope, we identified that Zika discussion dynamics on Twitter were decoupled from the actual disease epidemic in the United States but were closely related to and highly influenced by certain sporadic real-world events as well as by a few influential users. This study provided a methodology framework and insights to better understand the driving forces of web-based public discourse during health emergencies. Therefore, health agencies could deliver more effective and efficient web-based communications in emerging crises. © Lida Safarnejad, Qian Xu, Yaorong Ge, Arunkumar Bagavathi, Siddharth Krishnan, Shi Chen."

Not surprisingly, micro-celebrities on digital media have become the new promotional tool for product endorsements. Companies too are increasingly shifting from traditional celebrity endorsers to famous online influencers. However, concerns regarding the self-presentation and credibility of these insta-celebrities remain. This study combines the theoretical framework of the self-representation theory related to Goffman and Ohanian’s source credibility model which comprises the three facets of attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise leading to purchase intention. This research attempts to examine the connections between online presentation and source credibility of micro-celebrities on Instagram to develop a modified source credibility model in the context of current digital media. Interpretive paradigm via in-depth interviews with 46 active Bangladeshi Instagram users were used to explore the dimensions of source credibility and self-presentations of micro-celebrities that influence the purchase decision of the users. The findings show that credibility can be achieved among the followers if the micro-celebrities follow certain criteria in terms of online behaviour presented in the modified framework of source credibility. © SEARCH Journal 2020."

Objectives: To answer: 1) what skin of color-related dermatology content is being posted on Instagram? And 2) who is producing this content? Design: Cross-sectional epidemiologic study analyzing the content of posts associated with 31 Instagram skin of color dermatology-related topics (hashtags). Setting: Population-based Participants: The Instagram accounts linked with the top 9 posts as generated by the Instagram algorithm associated with each search term. Exposures: Instagram account holders. Main Outcomes and Measures: [1] The number of posts associated with each skin of color dermatology hashtag search term. [2] Classification of posts as either educational or promotional. [3] Classification of posts as a photo or video. [4] Classification of Instagram accounts that produced the posts (American board-certified dermatologists, dermatology residents, foreign dermatologists, patients, medical interest groups, or other). [5] Quantification of the number of post likes and comments. [6] Comparison of number of educational and promotional posts between board-certified dermatologists and other Instagram users. Results: The 31 sampled hashtags were associated with a total of 9,087,589 posts as of January 16, 2020. 219 of the 288 top posts generated from these queries met inclusion criteria. Board-certified dermatologists (26 posts) only generated 12% of top posts, whereas individuals not certified in dermatology produced 88% of top content. Of this group, social media influencers were the largest subcategory (37 posts). A majority of the top posts were promotional (135 posts, 61.6%) and formatted as photos (181 posts, 82.6%). While there was a significant difference in the number of likes for content posted by board-certified dermatologists vs non-dermatologists (P=0.027), these differences became non-significant after stratifying by the intention of the post (promotional P=0.13, educational P=0.17). Conclusions and Relevance: Board-certified dermatologists are underrepresented among people generating top skin of color dermatology-related content on Instagram. Board-certified dermatologists should establish a more prominent presence on social media platforms so that patients have greater access to accurate, evidenced-based educational resources regarding dermatologic conditions, treatment options, and treatment risks from reliable sources.

This policy statement reviews the forms of advertising that children and teenagers encounter, including newer forms of digital marketing, such as sponsored content, influencers, data collection, persuasive design, and personalized behavioral marketing driven by machine learning. Parents and pediatric health care providers need to be aware of the ways different marketing messages reach children and teenagers, including Internet sites, social media, and mobile apps. Evidence suggests that exposure to advertising is associated with unhealthy behaviors, such as intake of high-calorie, low-nutrient food and beverages; use of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes; use of alcohol and marijuana; and indoor tanning. Children are uniquely vulnerable to the persuasive effects of advertising because of immature critical thinking skills and impulse inhibition. School-aged children and teenagers may be able to recognize advertising but often are not able to resist it when it is embedded within trusted social networks, encouraged by celebrity influencers, or delivered next to personalized content. This policy statement expresses concern about the practice of tracking and using children's digital behavior to inform targeted marketing campaigns, which may contribute to health disparities among vulnerable children or populations. Pediatricians should guide parents and children to develop digital literacy skills to prevent or mitigate negative outcomes, but it is equally important that policy makers and technology companies embrace digital design, data collection, and marketing practices within today's broad digital environment that support healthier decision-making and outcomes.

Source credibility and, to an extent, authenticity have been widely studied in marketing and communications but have not yet been considered in the context of nutrition or health communication. Thus, an investigation into the factors that impact perceived source and message credibility and authenticity is of interest to inform health communication on SM. Objective: This study aims to explore the factors that impact message and source credibility (which includes trustworthiness and expertise) or authenticity judgments on SM platforms to better inform nutrition science SM communication best practices. Methods: A total of 6 databases across a variety of disciplines were searched in March 2019. The inclusion criteria were experimental studies, studies focusing on microblogs, studies focusing on healthy adult populations, and studies focusing on either source credibility or authenticity. Exclusion criteria were studies involving participants aged under 18 years and clinical populations, gray literature, blogs, WeChat conversations, web-based reviews, non-English papers, and studies not involving participants' perceptions. Results: Overall, 22 eligible papers were included, giving a total of 25 research studies. Among these studies, Facebook and Twitter were the most common SM platforms investigated. The most effective communication style differed depending on the SM platform. Factors reported to impact credibility included language used online, expertise heuristics, and bandwagon heuristics. No papers were found that assessed authenticity. Conclusions: Credibility and authenticity are important concepts studied extensively in the marketing and communications disciplines; however, further research is required in a health context.

Given that social media platforms were originally designed to facilitate personal bonding and not product or brand recommendations, we posited that social media followers' emotional attachment to SMIs is an important precedent that affects the followers' behavioral inclination to accept the SMIs' endorsements. We thus drew new attention to the relationship between SMIs and their followers by focusing on their attachment development mechanism and its casual factors and effects. In doing so, Study 1 inductively analyzed the key causal factors, both with respect to SMI persona- and content-driven attributes, that make followers feel attached to SMIs. By integrating the findings of Study 1 with the human brand theory, Study 2 provided empirical evidence after analyzing 325 U.S. consumers' responses about how SMIs' personas (i.e., inspiration, enjoyability, and similarity) and content curation abilities (i.e., informativeness) affected followers to perceive the SMIs as human brands who fulfill their needs for ideality, relatedness, and competence—all of which resulted in an intense attachment to SMIs. It was this positive emotion shaped with SMIs that transferred to SMIs’ endorsements and positively influenced the followers to acquire the products/brands that the SMIs recommended. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Despite such growth, relatively little strategic or academic insight exists that is specific to influencers. In this article, we describe the roots of influencer marketing and the many different types of influencers that now exist. We identify influencers’ three functional components: the audience, the endorser, and the social media manager. We then detail for each of these components the different sources of value influencers potentially offer marketers. We draw on relevant academic research to offer advice about how to leverage each component strategically.

Using data from the 2019 Australian Open grand slam period, the authors examine Adler's (1985) theoretical construct in the context of sports and social media. A social listening tool is used to probe more than 2 million posts and comments mentioning elite male and female tennis players on four major social media channels: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, over the grand slam period. It is shown that the effect of professional tennis players on social media user engagement extends beyond their talent. A selection of players had a strong positive impact on prompting social media activity, even after accounting for factors related to their performance, the tournament rounds in which they were featured and the opponents against whom they played. Furthermore, the connection between social media research and sports economics is considered by examining the relationship between a player's effects on social media engagement and her/his differential influence on demand for tickets at the Australian Tennis Open.

Luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Prada are increasingly partnering with them to promote their new line of products. Lil Miquela, the most popular virtual influencer, has 1.7 million followers on Instagram. She is fictional, recognizes herself as a robot, but displays human emotions through her posts and interactions with her followers. Generally, research suggests that virtual influencers offer novelty but may lack authenticity and reliability like human social influencers. Despite increased recent media attention on the topic, to our knowledge, there is no empirical research on the effectiveness of using virtual influencers as a marketing gimmick. Due to lack of literature in the field, we chose an exploratory qualitative design to explore the advantages and disadvantages of using fictional characters as a marketing strategy. We administered semi-structured interviews with six experts in the field of digital media. Thematic analysis was utilized to explore repetitive patterns in their opinions and suggestions. The respondents primarily highlighted potential challenges of using virtual influencers, identified factors which may make them successful as a marketing strategy, and compared the appeal of humanized versus animated virtual influencers. © 2020 IEEE."

In our earlier research work, we proposed a systematic framework for SLA. Our motivation in this research study was to discuss the results of our findings. We deployed the SLA framework in the course- “Effective Public Speaking” that was offered in a premier Indian university. We also placed a few constraints in the way participants participated on Twitter. The sample included 60 students enrolled in the course and two groups were formed - 30 students of the experiment set-up and 30 students for the control group set-up. Both the groups had an equal percentage of male and female gender participants. A pre-test was used to measure the students' knowledge of the writing, usage and vocabulary. At the end of the experiment, a post-test was done to measure students' writing, usage and vocabulary. In both tests, the students were required to complete questions on writing, usage and vocabulary. Both the pre-test and post-test results were compared. After conducting the post-test, a survey questionnaire was given to the participants to explore their attitudes towards using Twitter for the purpose of learning SLA. We made several observations on our SLA framework for SLA learners. First, participants writing skills improved noticeably. Second, the usage of correct and appropriate vocabulary improved. Third, influencers on the SLA network triggered the SLA acquisition among the participants. Last but not least SLA showed considerable improvement when participants were allowed to receive and respond. We also proposed guidelines and strategies for the instructors to deploy and utilize the SLA framework for effective SLA learning. © 2020 Asian E F L Journal Press. All rights reserved."

In order to increase engagement with nutrition professionals (NPs) on social media, we aimed to explore young adults’ perceptions of the authenticity and trustworthiness of SMIs and NPs Instagram posts. A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to students (n = 149) from an Australian University. Participants viewed a real-life Instagram profile and one post from both a NP and a SMI. Main outcomes were post authenticity and trustworthiness, and emotional message appeals measured on five-point Likert scales. Regression models were developed to assess whose post (the NP or SMI) was perceived to be more authentic and trustworthy. Participants were young adults (median age (25th, 75th percentiles): 20 (19,21)), with approximately half identifying as female. A high heroic message appeal (+1SD above mean) significantly increased the perceived authenticity of the NPs post only (p = 0.01). Post authenticity enhanced post trustworthiness, but only when a heroic message appeal was used by the NP. When appropriate, NPs should convey positive emotions such as bravery and success to enhance the authenticity and trustworthiness of their posts. © 2020 by the authors.

Credibility, pleasantness, and emotions are the criteria analyzed through multivariate analysis applied over two independent samples of followers. Pleasantness and appearance in the macro influencer scenario and perceived integrity in that of the micro influencer appear to conflict with the desired transparency of the message, while transmission of emotions plays an essential role in both scenarios.

Methods: The search function of Twitter (TW) and Instagram (IG) was used to generate a list of accounts with the terms: fertility, infertility, ttc, egg freezing, ivf, endometriosis, and reproductive. Accounts not in English, in private, with no posts in > 1 year, or with content unrelated to search terms were excluded. Accounts were assessed for author type; REI board certification (REI-BC); influencer (INF) status (> 10 K followers on IG; verified check mark on TW); account demographics; and content in last 5 posts. Statistical analysis included unpaired t tests, a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, and stepwise multiple logistic regression. Results: Seven hundred ten accounts were identified and 537 (278 TW, 259 IG) were included. Account types included societies, clinics, physicians, patients, groups, and “other.” Instagram content (1290 posts reviewed) was primarily personal stories (31.7%) or inspiration/support (23.7%). Twitter content (1390 posts reviewed) was mostly promotion (28.2%) and research/education (20.2%). Thirty-nine accounts (12.5%) were influencers. Fertility influencers were most often awareness/support accounts (59.8% TW, 25.0% IG), patients (12.8% TW, 25% IG), or other (17.9% TW, 21.0% IG). Only 7.7% TW and 7.1% IG INFs were board-certified REI physicians. The best predictor for classification as an influencer was high activity (> 50 posts/month TW, > 10 posts/month IG). Conclusion: As patients increasingly utilize social media to obtain and engage with health information, it is critical to understand the fertility-related SM landscape. This understanding may help to successfully enhance relationships with patients and ensure dissemination of accurate information. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

The current study investigates the most common angles employed by various user cohorts when posting a selfie on social media platforms and proposes that aesthetic surgeons consider utilizing a selfie angle alongside standard pre- and postoperative photographic views. Methods: Full face photographs published on the social media platform Instagram™ with the tag #selfie were divided into three cohorts: female models/influencers, amateur females, and amateur males. Each cohort contained 100 photographs. The photographs were analyzed using cloud-based facial analysis software for facial pan, roll, and tilt relative to the camera. Results: One hundred photographs from each cohort were analyzed and demonstrated that amateur females (AF) take photographs from higher angles than amateur males (AM) or model females (MF). Roll-off-midline was significantly greater for AF and MF as compared to AM. The MF group had significantly a greater pan-off-midline as compared to AF and AM, while AF had significantly a greater pan-off-midline than AM. Conclusions: Common photography practices employed within selfie photographs utilize angles not captured in standard perioperative photographs. This study supports the implementation of a selfie photograph into the standard set of pre- and postoperative photographs taken by aesthetic surgeons to evaluate the effects of interventions in the context of selfie photography. The angle employed can vary depending upon the demographic profile of the patient. Level of Evidence V: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

We administered an online survey to a random sample of 434 U.S. Millennials. Results showed that psychological proximity (i.e. cognitive and emotional proximities) predicted positive attitudes toward recycling, intentions to like, share, and comment on posts of recycling-related social media campaigns, and to engage in recycling behaviors. The perceived influence of social ties (i.e. strong ties and weak ties) moderated the relationship between psychological proximity and attitudes toward recycling as well as offline recycling intentions. The results revealed that Millennials who perceive a stronger influence of their social ties, both strong and weak ties, rely less on their psychological proximity to determine their attitudes and offline behavioral intentions, indicating the critical influence of social ties.

Some nurses have used Instagram to document their experiences as a nurse and have subsequently gained microcelebrity status-that is, a user who purposefully seeks to amass a substantive Web-based following and has become recognized as a niche area of interest. Objective: This study aimed to identify the characteristics and behaviors of microcelebrity nurses who act as influencers on Instagram and use their nursing profile to gain attention and presence on the Web. Methods: A qualitative, exploratory, nonparticipatory content analysis of media and text generated by a purposeful sample of 10 registered nurses who use Instagram and sustain a definable microcelebrity status was conducted. In this study, manifest and latent data were examined to gain an understanding of the characteristics and behaviors of nurses who have attained microcelebrity status on Instagram. Results: Data analysis revealed 5 themes of Instagram posts: (1) engaging Instagram users, (2) educational opportunities and insights, (3) nursing-related humor, (4) emotions experienced by nurses, and (5) media and narratives including patient details or work context. Messages were primarily positive in nature; however, multiple potential privacy, ethical, and professional issues were noted throughout the posted content. Conclusions: The findings of this study help to expand the current knowledge related to the use of social media platforms such as Instagram, especially in regard to the emergence of nurses who use this form of technology to achieve or maintain a microcelebrity status. This study calls for additional research on nurses' attainment of microcelebrity status on social media as well as further policy development to adequately prepare nurses to navigate social media. © Hanna Kerr, Richard Booth, Kimberley Jackson.

To date, there appear to be no published studies assessing the quality of oral hygiene instruction provided by YouTube videos. Objective To assess the availability, quality and accuracy of patient-focused YouTube videos aiming to provide oral hygiene instruction. Method YouTube videos meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated for quality and information accuracy using an eight-item, evidence-based checklist relating to important aspects in the prevention of caries and periodontal disease. Results Fifty-two relevant videos were included; 20 videos (38.5%) were produced by lay people (social media influencers and bloggers) who had no professional qualifications. None of the included videos contained accurate information relating to all eight items of the evidence-based checklist. Seven videos contained none of the information from the checklist. Numerous videos contained health advice which was not scientifically sound. Conclusion The results of this study highlight that currently available YouTube videos may not contain evidence-based information relating to oral hygiene instruction. There are also concerns regarding the lack of regulation and quality assurance processes in the development of healthcare-related YouTube videos.

No-till is a low disturbance farming practice with potential to benefit soil health, the aquatic environment and farm economy, but is currently only implemented at a small scale in Europe. Interpersonal networks are important for farmers and influence farmer learning and decision-making and farmers often view each other as their main source of information. In this study, the social networks of 16 no-till farmers in England were mapped and semi-structured interviews carried out to assess the link between farmer network characteristics and the implementation of no-till in England. We also aimed to improve our understanding of the nature and extent of knowledge exchanged within farmer networks and their spatial and temporal dynamics. Our findings suggest that intermediary farmers had an important role in increasing the information flow and knowledge exchange between the different clusters of the no-till farmer network. These intermediaries were also the biggest influencers as they were often no-till farmers with a high level of experiential knowledge and viewed as important sources of information by other farmers. No-till farmer networks were geographically distributed as the farmers preferred to discuss farming practices with similar minded no-till farmers rather than local conventional farmers who did not understand what they were trying to achieve. Therefore, online communication platforms like social media were important for communication. We question the role of formal extension services in supporting farmers with innovative practices like no-till and suggest that advisors should strive to improve their understanding of these well-developed information networks to enable a more streamlined and efficient information diffusion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

The reach, frequency, and speed of communication on social media offer the ideal leverage for the drivers of entrepreneurial marketing. However, the rapid rate of change may threaten the effects of investments in entrepreneurial marketing on social media and they might become only short-lived. Employing structural equation modeling, we test the long-term effect of Facebook-based celebrity endorsement on purchase intention among 234 members of a Facebook fan community in a two-wave longitudinal design.

Analyzing the communicative strategies of two Egyptian political influencers –Ammar Ali Hassan and Ezzedine Fishere– ten years after Egypt’s political change, and the role they play in public discourse through their Twitter accounts, this research offers an overview of the current role played by Egyptian digital political influencers in influencing public opinion. Focusing on the content and discourse of their tweets for two months, October and November 2019, the digital political influencers were selected based on the number of followers divided by the amount of interactivity on their tweets, such as retweets and favorites. The unit of analysis is the tweet that received the largest amount of interactivity. Results showed that both influencers had a unidirectional opinion strategy. While Hassan’s tweets, @ammaralihassan, seemed purposeless, not yielding any clear and valuable content to the reader, Fishere, @FishereEzzedine, was more outspoken and clearer in his communicative strategy, using evidence in defending human rights in Egypt and the Arab World.

This study aims to test interaction effects among luxury brand posts’ Instagram source type (brand versus fashionista), visual image type (product-centric versus consumer-centric) and consumers’ characteristics (vanity, opinion leadership and fashion consciousness) on brand recognition and trust. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative 2 (source type: brand versus fashionista) × 2 (branded visual image type: product-centric luxury versus consumer-centric luxury) between-subjects online experiment (N males = 195 and N females = 182) was conducted by recruiting participants from MTurk. Findings: Logistic regression analyses indicated two-way interaction effects between sources and visual images on brand recognition. Brand recognition was higher for product-centric images when the source was the fashionista, whereas brand recognition was equivalent regardless of the image type when the source was the brand. Logistic regression and multiple regression analyses revealed the moderating effects of sources and visual images on the association between consumer traits and branding outcomes. Practical implications: Meticulously choosing effective methods of showcasing branded content and persuasive luxury visual image strategies via Instagram is more important for fashionistas than for established brands in increasing brand recognition. Instagram fashionistas are more effective in increasing females’ brand trust through delivering product-centric visual images when targeting women with high vanity, opinion leadership and fashion consciousness. Brands as the Instagram profile source are more persuasive in increasing males’ brand trust through delivering product-centric visual images when targeting men with high vanity.

The objective of the current study is to investigate how content and source features of Twitter messages about truth® campaigns influence their popularity, support, and reach. Keyword rules were used to collect tweets related to each of the six campaigns from the Twitter Firehose posted between August 2014 and June 2016. Data were analyzed using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, keyword algorithms, and human coding. Tweets were categorized by source type (direct or truth®-owned social influencer; non-influencer). Tweet content was coded and classified for valence and campaign references (branded vs. non-branded or organic content). Message reach was calculated by source type and message type. Keyword filters captured 308,216 tweets posted by 225,912 Twitter users. Findings revealed that campaigns that utilized social influencers as message sources generated more campaign-branded and sharable content (e.g., campaign hashtags) and greater volume of tweets per day and reach per day. Influential users posted fewer organic messages and more branded/sharable content, generating greater reach compared to non-influencers. Oppositional messages decreased over time.

The impact of social media on diffusion of sustainable mobility opinions is not well-understood given the present lack of data. To address this gap, this paper introduces a modeling framework for the impact of social media on opinion diffusion. Inspired by Roger's diffusion theory, the framework applies different learning mechanisms (e.g., word-of-mouth and mass media) in network architectures to explore the effects of network topology on acceptance of green travel alternatives using conceptual idealizations of the complex processes involved in diffusion interactions. We present a dynamic agent-based simulation methodology capturing the impact of information and communications technology (ICT) like social media on diffusion of environmentally friendly travel mode consideration through social networks. The agent-based models provide visual comparisons of the effects of network structure and social media influence on opinion diffusion, the way opinions spread, and which agents exhibit the strongest influence. We identify types of social media influencers that most effectively encourage adoption of sustainable transportation alternatives and present an illustrative framework of the mechanisms that drive opinion diffusion. Exploratory findings suggest that: (1) scale-free networks provide the slowest initial diffusion rate but the greatest overall diffusion over time, (2) the most effective behavior incentivization strategies depend on network structure, (3) in scale-free networks, increasing the number of initial opinion leaders improves diffusion, while increasing the number of communication encounters within the network over the first year following product deployment does not noticeably improve diffusion, and (4) providing smaller financial incentives to a greater number of opinion leaders is the best strategy. © 2020"

For advertisers, vlogs are an excellent way to reach young viewers. As such, vlogs have become a powerful marketing tool. However, for children and adolescents it is often unclear whether a vlog contains advertising, which raises questions regarding the fairness and transparency of this type of advertising. If children do not recognize the commercial intent of in-vlog advertising, then they are unlikely to activate their advertising literacy, which may serve as a critical coping mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate if a sponsorship disclosure stimulates children and adolescents’ (7–16 years old) to activate their advertising literacy when exposed to embedded advertising in vlogs and, subsequently, if advertising literacy activation is related to children’s brand attitude. Furthermore, we investigated whether the relation between exposure to a sponsorship disclosure and advertising literacy activation was moderated by children’s dispositional advertising literacy and their age. An innovative aspect of the current study is that advertising literacy activation was measured in two ways: with a self-reported questionnaire and via an indirect measurement task (Advertising Literacy Activation Task). The results showed that the children who were exposed to a sponsorship disclosure did not activate their advertising literacy to a higher extent than the children who were not exposed to such a disclosure. This might be because of the high prominence of the brand in the vlog; thus children may not have needed the disclosure to realize that the vlog was sponsored and accordingly activate their advertising literacy. The results also showed that stronger attitudinal advertising literacy activation led to a more negative brand attitude. Interestingly, this effect was only found when attitudinal advertising literacy was assessed with a questionnaire and not when it was assessed with the indirect measurement task. Thus, children who were more critical toward the in-vlog advertisement through self-reporting also had a more negative brand attitude. This suggests that direct and indirect measurements of advertising literacy activation reveal different processes through which children make sense of, and are affected by, advertising. © Copyright © 2020 Hoek, Rozendaal, van Schie, van Reijmersdal and Buijzen."

In this work, we have modeled the discourse used in two domains, banking and automotive, as well as the language used by the influencers in such domains and by their followers, and used these Language Models to estimate the probability of being influencer. Our most remarkable finding is that influencers not only depend on their expertise on the domain but also on that of their followers, so that the more knowledge and number of experts among their followers, the more probability of being influencer a profile has. © 2020 Sociedad Espanola para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.

The analysis proceeded in four perspectives based on Lefebvre's theoretical framework: the festivalization of everyday life, the artification of everyday life, the holistic stylization of everyday life, and cultural revolution as a daily practice. Instagram, the case for this study and the most popular image-centric social network, leads the digital aesthetics paradigm through creative acts that weave fashion into the daily life of the individual. The study focuses on three fashion mega-influencers whose successful careers began with blogs documenting their daily lives. The analysis showed that Instagram, as a social platform, is a creative space for sharing everyday life with its appropriation of time and space. In there, fashion visualizes the look of the everyday beyond the boundaries of time and space. In practice, it suggests a digital cultural revolution: a composite lifestyle expressive of various tastes and styles-a vital medium to inspire and sustain fashion everydayness. This has implications that the information and communication technology of the digital age created a new cultural space and that daily visualization through fashion will eventually produce sustainable cultural contents. © 2020 by the authors."

Objective: This study aimed to quantify the characteristics of gun advertising on social media and to compare the reach of posts by manufacturers with those of influencers. Methods: Using a systematic search, we created a database of recent and popular Twitter and YouTube posts made public by major firearm manufacturers and influencers. From our sample of social media posts, we reviewed the content of the posts on the basis of 19 different characteristics, such as type of gun, presence of women, and military or police references. Our content analysis summarized statistical differences in the information conveyed in posts to compare advertising approaches across social media platforms. Results: Sample posts revealed that firearm manufacturers use social media to attract audiences to websites that sell firearms: 14.1% (131/928; ±2.9) of Twitter posts, 53.6% (228/425; ±6.2) of YouTube videos, and 89.5% (214/239; ±5.1) of YouTube influencer videos link to websites that facilitate sales. Advertisements included women in efforts to market handguns and pistols for the purpose of protection: videos with women included protection themes 2.5 times more often than videos without women. Top manufacturers of domestic firearms received 98 million channel views, compared with 6.1 billion channel views received by the top 12 YouTube influencers. Conclusions: Firearm companies use social media as an advertising platform to connect viewers to websites that sell guns. Gun manufacturers appropriate YouTube servers, video streaming services, and the work of YouTube influencers to reach large audiences to promote the widespread sale of consumer firearms. YouTube and Twitter subsidize gun advertising by offering server and streaming services at no cost to gun manufacturers, to the commercial benefit of Google and Twitter’s corporate ownership. ©Lisa Jordan, James Kalin, Colleen Dabrowski."

However, the exposure of adolescents to images that promote the slender beauty ideal can lead to body dissatisfaction, as they place a lot of importance on the likes and comments they receive regarding the comparison of their appearance with that of other users. The popularity of influencers and their opinion leadership has resulted in the convergence of a given body image with the promotion of products and brands. Through the use of neuromarketing techniques –attention through eye tracking, and emotion using galvanic skin response–, the objective of this research is to determine the cognitive perception that Spanish adolescents and young people have of the stimuli transmitted by influencers on Instagram, surpassing classic content analysis of social networks and offering the innovative technique of registering unconscious reactions of the audience, both toward the body image as well as toward the brands promoted by influencers who are akin to the audience. The results suggest that adolescents place greater attention and emotional intensity on the nude body appeal of influencers compared to young adults, and show only scarce interest in brands. © 2020 The Author(s)Psychology; Marketing; Social Media; Influencer; Instagram; Neuromarketing; Body image; Personal identity; Brand management; Eye tracking; Galvanic Skin Response © 2020 The Author(s)"

An online experiment among 221 general consumers in the United States was conducted. The results demonstrated that negative messages regarding CSR distributed by employees in face-to-face communication decreased publics’ favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions to a greater extent than that distributed via social media (i.e., Facebook). However, the effect of communication channel became insignificant when positive messages regarding CSR were shared by employees. The results further showed that perceived authenticity mediated the effects of channel and message valence on publics’ attitudes and behavioral intentions.

Politicians communicate through presentational (e.g., social media) and representational (e.g., press) outlets, and the compatibility between these outlets represents the leader’s effectiveness in transmitting the desired messages to the audience. The authors of this study suggest a theoretical framework that classifies public figures’ communication along two dimensions: universality (particular–universal) and media compatibility (low–high). The authors used language processing tools to study the sentiment, topic mixture, and use of pronouns by 61 global world leaders in more than 300,000 messages from the leaders’ Twitter accounts and press articles. The results show a high level of universality across political leaders in sentiment, topic mixture, and pronoun usage. The media compatibility is high, with Twitter being slightly more positive. Most leaders fall within the categories of Cosmopolitan Antagonist (high universality, low media compatibility) and Global Icon (high universality, high media compatibility). Overall, the sentiment of their communications is positive. Popular topics include diplomacy, economy, corruption, and the Arab world.

Celebrity’s relationship to another form of public identity—the politician/political leader—is conceptually and practically connected by their shared relationship to the popular and its articulation through the various mediated forms of popular culture. This connection to popular culture is one of the ways in which power is legitimized as the politician or celebrity is authenticated by their capacity to embody the citizenry in one sphere and the audience in another. This paper argues that there has been a significant transformation in our constitution of fame in the contemporary moment that has fundamentally shifted this fame/politics nexus. The key element of this shift is the way in which digital media has reconfigured our political-popular cultural landscape. It is argued that via the communicative structures of social media and its avenues of sharing and connecting, there has developed a pandemic will-to-public identity by the billions of users of online culture—what is identified as pandemic persona—that resembles the patterns with which celebrity and politicians have operated over the previous century. Pandemic persona has produced a new instability in the organization of contemporary politics as this new public intermediary insinuates itself in unpredictable ways into the way that the process of representation in both popular and political culture manifests itself in what could be seen as legacy media and legacy formations of political institutions and practices. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Moreover, this research investigated two potential mediators underlying this relationship: identification (perceived similarity and wishful identification) and credibility (trustworthiness and expertise). Two experiments (N = 131, N = 446) investigated celebrity vs. influencer endorsers with good vs. poor fit with a beauty and a fitness product (Study 1), or a food and a fashion product (Study 2). Overall, our results showed that participants identify more with influencers than celebrities, feel more similar to influencers than celebrities, and trust influencers more than celebrities.

Respondents were included if they reported exercise at least thrice weekly, were above 15 years of age, and provided informed consent (N = 3088). Problem gambling, measured with the Lie/Bet, was studied in association with demographic data, substance use, and mental health variables. The occurrence of lifetime problem gambling was 8 percent (12 percent in men, one percent in women). In logistic regression, problem gambling was associated with male gender, younger age, risky alcohol drinking, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and less frequent exercise habits.

Such posts can be of significant importance for future employees who use them as supposedly unbiased information of firm attractiveness. Hence better understanding such activity is a crucial element of many HR managers. In this study we rely on signaling theory to explore the relationships between corporate brand strength, corporate social media activity and company-related posts by employees on social media channels. To analyze those relationships, we apply variance-based structural equation modeling (PLS SEM) based on data from a survey among scholars who published in A-journals. Our results show that corporate brand strength alone is not sufficient to mobilize employees to upload company-related posts. However, corporate brand strength influences corporate social media activity, which, in turn, impacts company-related posts by employees on social media. We highlight the crucial role of employees as spokespeople and influencers for firms, especially vis-à-vis applicants and prospective employees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

To achieve transparency, Instagram has introduced a standardized disclosure (‘Paid partnership with [brand]’). This study examined whether this disclosure effectively raises ad recognition, and how this consequently affects consumers' responses to the message, influencer, and brand. Additionally, the effects of the disclosure were compared between micro- (<10,000 followers) and meso- (10,000–1 million followers) influencers. Results of an online experiment (N = 192) with a 2 (no disclosure vs. standardized disclosure) x 2 (micro-vs. meso-influencer) between subjects design showed that the disclosure did achieve its goal of increasing ad recognition. Furthermore, the disclosure positively affected brand recall and intentions to engage with the post, via ad recognition. The parasocial interaction with the influencer was not affected. Moreover, influencer type did not moderate the effect of the disclosure and did not affect people's responses to the message, influencer, or brand. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Because social influencers (i.e., individuals with the potential to influence large audiences on social media) may have a strong influence on young people, it is important to know whether and how often they post about alcohol. Furthermore, because by using influencers alcohol brands may have found a way to circumvent regulations that prohibit advertising for minors, it is important to understand whether alcohol brands are visible in influencers’ posts and whether influencers use disclosures (e.g., “#ad”) to notify viewers. In a content analysis of Instagram posts of 178 popular influencers, we investigated: (1) how many and how often influencers post about alcohol, (2) what type of influencers post about alcohol, (3) what the characteristics of influencers’ alcoholposts are, and (4) to what extent these alcoholposts are commercialized (e.g., by showing brands and sponsorship disclosures). Results showed four main findings. (1) The majority of influencers (i.e., 63.5%) posted about alcohol recently. (2) Alcoholposts were positive, showed a social context, and were mostly posted by lifestyle influencers. (3) Although a fair amount of alcoholposts (19.5%) showed a clear alcohol brand, only a few of these posts disclosed this as an advertisement, and even fewer gave an educational slogan (i.e., “#no18noalcohol”). (4) Posts with sponsorship disclosures yielded fewer likes and comments than posts without such disclosures. A post hoc additional study that focused solely on minors confirmed these conclusions. These findings suggest that there is a lot to be concerned about in this context, especially since many minors can be exposed to influencers’ alcoholposts, potentially leading to increased drinking among this vulnerable age group. We therefore advice future researchers to further investigate this topic, and propose that legislation for alcohol advertising needs to be adjusted to account for the context of social networking sites. © Copyright © 2020 Hendriks, Wilmsen, van Dalen and Gebhardt."

Children particularly like content that is specifically created for YouTube by YouTube personalities. Because these personalities have a large reach and are considered likeable and credible, they have become social media influencers. For advertisers, these influencers are an interesting channel to reach youth. Therefore, influencers often embed persuasive sponsored messages in their videos to earn money. However, there are concerns about this practice because it is not always clear when a video includes advertising. Therefore, in several countries, guidelines have been developed that state that sponsoring in influencer videos should be disclosed as such. Until now, little is known about the effects of disclosures for influencer videos on children and the boundary conditions for such effects. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a disclosure of sponsored influencer videos on children’s advertising literacy. Additionally, we examined the consequences of the disclosure for children’s responses to the brand, advertised product, and video. We also included the para-social relationship (PSR) that children experience with an influencer as a possible boundary condition for disclosure effects on persuasion. Our experiment amongst children between 8 and 12 years old showed that, when children correctly recalled the disclosure, the disclosure increased their recognition of advertising, and understanding of selling and persuasive intent. Moreover, advertising literacy evoked by the disclosure affected persuasion: The disclosure enhanced brand memory through ad recognition, but also decreased advertised product desire through understanding the selling intent of the video. Furthermore, the PSR of children with the influencer proved to be a boundary condition for disclosure effects on brand attitudes. Only for those children who experienced moderate to low PSRs with the influencer, the disclosure resulted in less positive brand attitudes through understanding selling intent. For children who experienced a strong PSR with the influencer, the understanding that the content had a selling intent did not affect their brand attitudes. These findings show that a disclosure (if noticed and remembered) can be an effective tool to achieve transparency, but also influences the persuasive outcomes of influencer marketing in online videos. © Copyright © 2020 Boerman and van Reijmersdal."

The social role of each end-user, influencers to followers, and content providers to receivers is a primary consideration when evaluating the purpose and contribution of any online community. Most existing research on the detection of social roles in online communities is based on manual observations and analysis. This paper introduces a technique for automating the detection and extraction of social roles from online communities. Given the large volume of text and value of content, it is no longer viable to manually encode and detect social roles and contributions. The machine learning approach is based on a deep recurrent neural network and a word embedding model. A dataset consisting of over 1.2 million textual posts extracted from an online community on higher education in Australia was used to demonstrate the technique. This technique can be applied to any online community to automatically identify social roles, their influence and interactions. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery."

As with more traditional media, social media influencers predominantly promote unhealthy drinks and foods that are high in sugar, fat, and salt – consumption of which may increase the risk of overweight, obesity, and non-communicable diseases. The aim of the current Brief Research Report is to examine the impact of vlogs on children’s unhealthy dietary behaviors. Drawing on longitudinal survey data from 453 8- to 12-year-old children, we analyzed the longitudinal relations between children’s frequency of watching vlogs and their consumption of unhealthy beverages and snacks. Structural path modeling analyses of three waves of data with 1-year intervals showed that children’s self-reported frequency of watching vlogs influenced consumption of unhealthy beverages 2 years later. The analyses did not yield significant relations for Unhealthy Snacks Consumption.

Data indicate that participants report a more favorable attitude toward a high-sincerity SMI, and envy was a significant moderator that enhanced participants’ attitude toward a low-sincerity influencer. In addition, whereas brand attitude did not differ by influencers’ sincerity levels for a symbolic product, the high-sincerity influencer was more effective in eliciting favorable brand attitude from participants when endorsing a utilitarian product.

This study qualitatively explored children’s understanding of, and attitudes towards, this marketing, to elucidate potential mechanisms through which exposure affects behavior. In six focus groups (n = 4) children (10–11 years) were shown a YouTube video featuring influencer marketing of an HFSS product. Inductive thematic analysis identified six themes from children’s discussions of this marketing: (1) YouTubers fill a gap in children’s lives, (2) the accessibility of YouTubers increases children’s understanding of their actions, (3) influencer marketing impacts all—the influencer, the brand, and the viewer, (4) attitudes towards influencer marketing are most affected by a YouTuber’s familiarity, (5) YouTuber influencer marketing is effective because they are not ‘strangers’, (6) children feel able to resist influencer marketing of HFSS products. Children had an understanding of the persuasive intent of this marketing, and although most were sceptical, familiar YouTubers elicited particularly sympathetic attitudes. Children felt affected by influencer marketing of HFSS products, but believed they were able to resist it. Beyond theoretical insight, this study adds to the growing body of evidence to suggest children’s exposure to HFSS influencer marketing should be reduced. © 2020 by the authors.

This article examines how the housewife ideal can be an attractive identity in the 2010s and, drawing on the post-humanist performativity by Karen Barad (2007), it maps the material-discursive agencies that enable the re-emergence of this figure. Building on in-depth interviews with women who refer to themselves as influencers and bloggers, and visual and textual analyses of their Instagram-accounts, including links to sponsors and comments from followers, the article analyzes how the tensions between these women's real lives and their cyber lives, become meaningful in this technological culture. The breaking of boundaries between human and non-human resulting from digital technology has re-configured the housewife role by transforming boundaries between intimate and commercial practices. By focusing on the three areas: Transforming the feminine body, Transforming Intimacy, and Entrepreneurial femininity the article shows how agency emerges from within transforming practices of body, intimacy and entrepreneurship, intra-acting within this new housewife phenomenon. In doing so it discusses the negotiations and space for agency these women thought that digital technologies provided for them. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, research on the impact of such disclosures is limited. This study used an experimental 4 × 2 between-subjects design (N = 414), reflecting different types of material connections between the influencer and the brand and two kinds of message sidedness, to investigate how the sponsorship disclosure affects consumers' responses to sponsored Instagram posts. Findings show that including a sponsorship disclosure (compared to no disclosure) negatively affects brand attitude through enhanced ad recognition, which activates ad skepticism, which, in turn, negatively affects the influencer's credibility. Further, results show a significant moderated mediation effect in that source's credibility and, consequently, brand attitude was only negatively affected when the influencer used a one-sided message and not when the message was two-sided. Also, influencers who post genuine product recommendations and thus have no commercial relationship with the brand, do well by explicitly mentioning this.

During the financial crisis, the luxury industry has not been affected by downturn much, also thanks to “Millennials”, who assign a symbolic meaning to luxury goods as they endow relevance to virtual windows created by social networks. The brands capable of seizing the opportunity of digital communication (i.e. e-commerce; social network pages; sponsorships and commercial agreements with “influencers”; etc.) have overcome the adverse economic cycle rapidly. The goal of the paper is to illustrate the case of a successful business, to demonstrate the connections either between the prevailing gender of human capital of a fashion retailer and its IT strategies or between the use of social networks and digital media and company’s performance. Particularly, the main research question is “can the gender affect the relevance of Information and Communication Technologies in a luxury fashion company?”. As digital communication is a resource for the future, is it able to guarantee stable revenues and income? If a business, thanks to social media, reaches the success, is this attainment independent by the history of the company and by the knowledge of the management team? Is it easier or more difficult for a woman to succeed in the luxury market than for a man? To answer the above questions, we selected a famous company, operating in the fashion luxury sector, managed by women and whose products are advertised or sold through digital channels; we considered its history and the profile of its management; then, we analysed not only its main historical financial ratios but also some “digital” indicators (such as the number of visitors, the number of online customers, etc.). By using a descriptive statistic method, we demonstrated that even if the use of information technology can improve the growth rate of a business, the knowledge, the human skills, the experience of the creative director as well as the quality of raw material can ensure the generation of stable positive results. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Due to the strong control users have over their self-images, Instagram is an attractive platform for narcissistic individuals, who want to showcase themselves in manners that benefit their own psychological needs (Moon et al. 2016). Also, the interactivity, online social-connection and ubiquitous characteristics of Instagram could entice compulsive social media users, who present uncontrollable needs to engage with social media platforms (Andreassen 2015). Furthermore, the perceived speed (Bridges and Florsheim 2008), the ease of the purchasing process and one-click settings could create a greater appeal for compulsive buyers than any other platform. As a result, Instagram could be an alluring platform for individuals with a great variety of psychological traits. The present study aimed to classify British Instagram users through their psychological traits and characteristics. The data was collected through the use of an online survey of a general consumer sample in the UK. It included Instagram usage questions, and questionnaires on narcissism, technostress, compulsive use and compulsive buying behaviors. We conducted a k-means cluster analysis, which yielded five distinct clusters: influencers, narcissists, muted, casual and pragmatists. Influencers presented no narcissistic tendencies but higher levels of technostress and compulsive traits; they had highest follower numbers and account checking frequency. Narcissists revealed strong narcissistic traits, compulsive tendencies and moderate technostress; however, they did not present higher posting or account checking behaviors. Muted are the largest group, they had the lowest followership, posting and account checking frequency; also, they presented the lowest levels of compulsive and narcissistic tendencies.

In 2016, firms invested more than $80 billion on influential social media users (ANA 2018). These users are considered “influential” as they contribute to the formation of attitudes toward products and services of a large number of other social media users. The basic idea underlying this novel marketing communication technique is that influencers build a relationship over time with those who follow their social media pages and thereby gain their trust and confidence. However, despite its massive growth and promising advantages, influencer marketing is still a considerably underexplored technique. Prior research has focused on influencer authenticity (Audrezet et al. 2018), likeability (De Veirman et al. 2017), the credibility of influencer posts (Boerman et al. 2017), and success metrics of influencer campaigns (Gräfe and Greff 2018), while the dynamics of influencer-follower relationships remain unexplored. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a life-cycle model of such influencer–follower relationships. Our results indicate that several properties of the influencer–follower relationship reflecting relevance-related aspects (e.g., interest in the influencer) and follower engagement (e.g., liking and sharing influencer posts), as well as relationship (e.g., commitment and trust) and consumption-related (e.g., purchase intentions) variables display an inverted U-shaped pattern over four consecutive relationship stages, namely, the phases of analysis, affection, attenuation, and alienation. By establishing a model that describes the dynamic evolution of influencer–follower relationships and by testing it through a variety of relational variables, we contribute to a better understanding of the development of the relationship between influencers and their followers. From a practical perspective, our findings suggest that not the number of followers per se but the number of followers in the peak stage of the influencer–follower relationship (referred to as affection phase) should be considered a key figure when planning campaigns. In addition, organizations can monitor the relationship development over time and offer insights to influencers in order to keep them relevant to their followers. Furthermore, our stage classification scheme may help influencers to analyze their follower base and manage their follower portfolio. In order to remain attractive to marketers in the long run, our results suggest that influencers should aim at having an ample number of followers situated in earlier relationship stages, indicating that popular influencers should not rest on a large number of followers and stop acquiring new followers. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

The proposed research presentations will address a wide range of cutting-edge topics—digital unengagement, access economy, smart interactive services, social media spokesperson character, influencer, and compulsive media use. These topics are timely, novel, and important and thus are expected to stimulate active discussions at the AMS conference. This special session attends to consumer well-being in digital environment in two ways: physical well-being and psychological well-being. As for the former, we attempt to explore the impact of interactive health applications and smart services. As for the latter, we focus on a social media environment and access economy, where issues related to world-of-mouth from and proper product/service representation are increasingly important. We strongly believe that this special session will effectively deliver one of the key AMS missions—“promoting high standards and excellence in the creation and dissemination of marketing knowledge and the furtherance of marketing practice through a role of leadership within the discipline of marketing around the world.” This session unites scholars from the United Kingdom and Japan, two of the G20 members that represent an important portion of world digital economy. The United Kingdom along with Germany account for 25% of the top 100 digital multinational enterprises, including Internet platforms, e-commerce, and digital content firms (UNCTAD 2017). Likewise, Japan is considered as the innovation hubs of automation, sensory technologies, and artificial intelligence (LSE Consulting 2018).

Studies have recently begun investigating the effects of influencers on consumer behavior. Owing to these people’s origins, they often appear more credible than celebrity testimonials (Djafarova and Rushworth 2017); consequently, they are deemed to have a greater influence than conventional advertising activities. Results by Dost et al. (2019) indicate that seeding campaigns, like social media-based influencer marketing, can increase the total sales of fast-moving consumer goods by between 3% and 18%. Despite the increasing interest, studies examining influencers’ tangible impact on consumer behavior are scarce. Researchers have only recently started investigating the effects of influencers empirically. Studies have shown that celebrities are less credible than influencers, although both impact consumers’ purchase behavior (Djafarova and Rushworth 2017). Furthermore, Lim et al. (2017) find that influencers’ source attractiveness positively effects consumers’ attitudes and purchase intention. An online study (n = 222) undertook new research to gain further understanding. Specifically, the study examines the following: first, the impact of consumers’ perceived influencer credibility, using the source credibility model by Ohanian (1990) in respect of attitude toward advertising, product liking, and purchase intention; second, the impact of the organizational behavior concept ‘psychological ownership’ based on Pierce et al. (2001) on consumer behavior by showing that the concept had significant positive effects on the product evaluation and on consumers’ willingness to buy like in prior research; third, the congruence and relationship between the influencer and the consumer in order to understand the relations. Results show that perceived influencer credibility serves as a significant criterion, determining the product and purchase’s persuasiveness, while contributing an instrument for transferring convincing messages to increase the perceived psychological ownership feeling for a product and, thus, influence consumer behavior positively. Theories on celebrity endorsement, their credibility, and their connection to the psychological ownership concept allowed a framework to be developed to assess the importance of influencer’s credibility and its influence on consumers’ perception of the products they advertise, to better understand the interactions in the influencer marketing context. Consequently, credible influencers can act as the tool to transfer their persuasive message, which increases customers’ psychological ownership feelings and influences consumers’ consumption behavior positively. This suggests that it is essential for companies to consider that kind of people who perceived as attractive, competent, and trustworthy for a specific target group to be most effective. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

AI is a branch of computer science that combines machine learning, logic and natural language processing to emulate human intelligence. By processing vast amounts of data and recognising patterns in the data, AI produces insights and analytics at or above human capability (IEEE 2017). It has been applied to fashion in trend forecasting, personalisation, customer interaction and the use of CGI models. For example, Amazon developed “Echo Look” which combines computer vision with predictive AI and human analysis to assess a consumer’s current wardrobe choices and provide recommendations of what to wear. Users can ask the machine to rate two different possible outfits in terms of current trends and actual appearance (Gibbs 2017). Online styling subscription Stitch Fix uses machine learning algorithms to determine its customers’ preferred styles and offer personalised recommendations. AI has also been developed to mimic the role of social media influencers and models. CGI character “Miquela” has 1.6 million Instagram followers, collaborates with luxury brands and launched her own clothing brand, but is not a real person. There is a dedicated digital modelling agency (Davis 2018). Such innovations are likely to further inflame the ongoing ethical debate about using digital technologies and virtual reality at the risk of opportunities for real people, for example diminishing already scarce opportunities for black models (Graham 2018), or introducing norms of artificial appearance and personal aesthetics impossible for ‘real’ people to achieve. AI has the potential to revolutionise fashion through greater precision, accuracy and effectiveness in decision-making, but at what cost? To what extent can and should AI replicate and replace human creativity and presence in an industry sector founded on human input in creating new trends? Yet, AI that predicts garment suitability and offers greater customisation for consumers may reduce waste and over-consumption (Snow 2017). Producing items which have greater relevance could reduce returns, markdowns and warehouse space, plus increase customer satisfaction and experience. Automating repetitive tasks could save money and time for greater value-added activities, for example through the use of chatbots for online customer service. This paper applies the lens of CSR to inform the debate on whether core fashion retailing functions can and should be replaced by AI. A CSR approach argues for businesses assuming social responsibilities beyond any economic, technical and legal obligations which constitute its existence, with the objective of reconciling economic, social and environmental objectives (Davis 1973). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

Studies have looked at the interaction of brands with consumers and their ability to advertise (Ashley and Tuten 2015; Hudson et al. 2016). However, utilizing social media platforms in marketing brings a challenge to brands due to its openness as well as fast changing nature (Colliander and Marder 2018). The luxury market will be worth nearly 375 billion by 2020, and millennials (Generation Y and Z Cohort) are expected to account for 45% of the global personal luxury goods market (Luxury Goods Market 2014; Solomon 2017). The millennial generation is extremely technology savvy and more likely to use the internet wirelessly, thus expecting to be engaged and communicated via online seamlessly (Chu and Kamal 2011). Parasocial Interaction Theory (PSI) is defined as “an illusionary experience, such that consumers interact with personas (i.e. mediated representations of presenters, celebrities, or characters) as if they are present and engage in a reciprocal relationship” (Labrecque 2014, p. 135). This study adopts Instagram, a visual-oriented social media platform, as the study context. As one of the popular social media platforms, Instagram is recognized as the most effective platform for luxury fashion brands (WWD Staff 2017). college students from a large Midwestern university were recruited (n = 385). The survey was consisted of 35 series of questions that assess brand relationship to a celebrity influencer and the brand on Instagram. The survey questionnaire included consumers’ perceived interactivity (McMillan and Hwang 2002; Labrecque 2014), similarity/likeability (Reysen 2005), parasocial interaction (Rubin et al. 1985; Labrecque 2014); willingness to share information (Schoenbachler and Gordon 2002; Labrecque 2014). A total of 121 usable responses were retained, and the data was analyzed using SPSS 22.0. Since this study is an exploratory nature, simple statistical analyses such as descriptive statistics, reliability tests, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), independent t-test, and regression analysis were conducted. This study concludes that people who follow both (brand and celebrity influencer) feel more interacted with the brand. Overall the millennial consumer prefers interactions with both brand and celebrity influencer, which would create a feeling of PSI. The results present that if a brand is using a celebrity influencer, influencer needs to be interacting with the followers on Instagram more often whereas a brand needs to be transparent on Instagram in order to gain trust of millennials through open conversations (e.g. what they offer, sustainability, communication, etc.). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

Communication through social influencers meets the needs of modern consumers through customization, perceived authenticity and interactivity. Given these benefits, it is crucial for brands to know the success factors of Social Influencer Marketing. So far, major research has been based mainly on digital performance indicators (KPIs) such as (high) number of followers, retweets or page rank. At first glance, these metrics seem to be excellent indicators of the success of a social influencer campaign. However, social influencer campaigns, which have failed despite full compliance with the requirements of these criteria, suggest that there are other relevant indicators, in particular credibility issues. This study will close this gap by examining the extent to which the requirements of the source-credibility model of Hovland et al. are relevant for social influencers. It analyzes to what extent the (1) attractiveness, (2) expertise and (3) trustworthiness of social influencers are relevant to an online social influencer campaign and the impact on brand perception constructs (brand satisfaction, brand image, brand trust) and behavior (purchase intention, willingness to pay a price premium). As fashion is the most common field of activity for social influencers, the focus is on an entry-level Brand for luxury fashion. The study focuses on micro-influencers as they are the key priority for fashion brands. The testing of hypotheses is done by Structural Equation Modeling. In total, 288 data sets were employed. The results show that the most important requirement is (3) trustworthiness followed by (1) attractiveness, while the relevance of (2) expertise is surprisingly close to zero. Thus, brands should especially pay attention to the issue that their influencers communicate in a way that is perceived (e.g. not distorted by the influence of third sources.) Based on these partially counter-intuitive outcomes, implications for management and further research are developed. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

Current knowledge on personal self-disclosure by marketing agents assert that such disclosure is detrimental to brands and should be avoided (Jacobs et al. 2001; Andersson et al. 2016). Influencers challenge this status quo, as self-disclosure is known to be central to their success. The aim of the present research is to provide the first understanding of the role of self-disclosure by SMI on consumer behaviour. Self-disclosure is “the act of revealing and sharing personal information with others” (Jourard 1971). Self-disclosure has two main dimensions which are breadth (quantity) and depth (quality) (Collins and Miller 1994). Breadth refers to the number of different topical areas (items) in a person’s life included in the disclosure (Utz 2015). On the other hand, depth refers to the level of intimacy of the information disclosed. A between-subject experiment (n = 454, 2 × 2 × 2) examined, disclosure depth, breadth and gender of Instagram travel influencers, on Appropriateness, Affective Trust, Cognitive Trust, Product Attitude, Purchase Intention, and Electronic Word of Mouth (eWOM). Findings, contrast existing knowledge promoting greater self-disclosure, leads to favourable consumer behaviour, a relationship mediated by appropriateness, affective and cognitive trust, and product attitude. Primarily this study extends knowledge of self-disclosure of marketing agents as well as highlight the importance of appropriateness. Implications for marketers are also provided. This paper has a multi-disciplinary nature and accordingly it contributes to different literatures. First, it extends literature of self-disclosure to new important key players on SNS, whom are SMI. Up to our knowledge none of the literature that explores SMI have focused on their self-disclosure and its impact on consumer behaviour. Additionally, this paper highlights the importance of appropriateness, which plays a key mediator role in this relationship. In terms of practical contribution, it provides important implications for influencers. For example, SMI should incorporate self-disclosure with high depth and breadth in their marketing strategy as long as it will be perceived as appropriate by their followers in order to have a positive impact on consumer behaviour. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

Methods: Symplur, a Twitter analytics service, was used to analyze Twitter activity, users and content for #Peyronies, the official hashtag for Peyronie's disease, between April 2013 and September 2018. Activity was measured by tweets per month and cumulative users per year. Users were classified based on geography, occupation and organizational affiliation. Content analysis was performed by retrieving information about Twitter engagement metrics including retweets, links, media, mentions, replies, frequently used words and hashtags. Results: A total of 3,278 tweets and 767 users employing #Peyronies were identified. Most tweets (75%) were sent with links and contained media images (49%). The average ± SD number of #Peyronies tweets per month increased from 17.7 ± 8.5 in 2013 to 121.4 ± 52.2 in 2018 (p <0.001). The number of users increased from 77 to 767 during this period and users tweeted from 61 countries. Physicians comprised 46% of the top influencers. Common words in #Peyronies tweets were ""disease,"" ""men"" and ""andropeyronie."" Popular associated hashtags were #menshealth, #peyronie and #men. Codification of tweet content revealed that tweets were focused on clinical care discussions or online patient support. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that Peyronie's disease Twitter discussions are growing. Although discussion volume is smaller relative to other benign urological pathologies such as kidney stones, this study shows that Peyronie's disease discussions are present on Twitter and are attracting users.

Consumers of the digital age browse the other users’ experiences and thoughts before purchasing a product or service. The use of social media (SM) platforms, which are getting stronger day by day, is also preferred by companies so as to convey any message to the target audiences. SM platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are the most outstanding and commonly used channels through which companies reach the target audiences. Sharing, especially including visual elements, supplies the highest level of interaction with the target audience. However, the internet bloggers/vloggers (video blogger), phenomena, influencers or SM marketers have a significant impact on the consumers of the digital age with their channels on the internet and their sharing in SM accounts. Tourism companies are not indifferent to the increasing importance of SM. Thus, they prefer working with SM influencers or bloggers by conveying the info and messages to their consumers to perceive their products and services. The influencers can spread the messages of the companies to wider consumers that companies might never be able to reach. For some years, the inclusion of influencers as part of a communication and marketing strategy has become more common and necessary for the promotion of a destination, airline or hotel group. This has been generated due to important factors such as trust, which has been the best ally of influencers: in most cases people give higher levels of credibility to what is said and done by instagramers, youtubers, bloggers, twitterers, etc. In recent years, it is one of the hottest new ways to affect potential guests’ buying decisions and create high-quality content without the excessive costs of most marketing efforts. © 2021 Emerald Publishing Limited."

This short inductive netnography develops the idea of a “luxury gaze” in which social media audience members view luxury with anticipation of intense pleasure, ameliorating ethical concerns. Several social media images of luxury selfies are read closely. The luxury selfie gaze concretizes an ascendant self-branding movement. Transformed by the self-realizational and self-help discourse into a therapeutic and philanthropic activity, luxury consumption is ennobled.

Such communication is necessary to build support for the uptake of scientific evidence in policymaking, to inform people about how the science behind the policies impacts their life and to improve public understanding of science. This type of communication requires that scientists, communicators and management work hand in hand from the beginning to (1) identify objectives, (2) define audiences, (3) and agree on tools and coordination. In other words, communication must stop being a mere afterthought and must instead be a joint venture of scientists and communicators right from the start of the research. To make it happen, often radical culture change is necessary, supported by appropriate planning, training, trust-building and high level management guidance. While this is difficult, it can also support the transition to Science for Policy 2.0 by exposing researchers to novel ways of communicating and thinking about their research.

Findings: The study’s results confirm that female Generation Y consumers have a favourable attitude towards beauty products and that this attitude is influenced by their subjective norms. Furthermore, the findings suggest that group influence, which includes the opinions of friends, family and peers and media influence both predict female Generation Y consumers’ favourable attitude towards beauty products via their influence on this segment’s subjective norms. Practical implications: These results emphasise the strategic importance of incorporating subjective norms, together with media and group influence into beauty product marketing communication campaigns targeting female Generation Y consumers. Given that this generation is known to be prevalent users of social media and often consult online peer product reviews, such strategies should also be extended beyond traditional media platforms to include social media, particularly social media influencers and online product review platforms, thereby tapping into subjective norms and group influence. Originality/value: This study contributes to understanding female Generation Y consumers’ attitudes towards beauty products, especially the combined influence of subjective norms and media and group influence on such attitudes. © 2020, Riane Cherylise Dalziel and Natasha De Klerk."

Yet, social media users quickly interpreted this supportive message of the refugee program as encouraging people to “accept and receive refugees” (jieshou nanmin) into China. Particularly, the category of Middle Eastern refugees elicited most criticism in China’s cyberspace. As the inclusion of refugees is an integral part of immigrant multiculturalism, this article examines the limits of multicultural imagination of refugees—particularly those from the Middle Eastern and North Africa—in contemporary China. I argue that the limits of multicultural imagination in contemporary China is profoundly shaped by an intricate interweaving of domestic policies and global imaginaries toward refugees. By deploying a mixed methodology, such limits are examined from legal-institutional, ideological, and sociocultural perspectives. More specifically, three interrelated aspects will be highlighted in the article: (1) the global circulation of right-wing populism imaginaries, and their entanglements with the anti-Muslim sentiments in contemporary China; (2) the current insufficiency of the legal-institutional framework regarding refugees and asylum-seekers, which needs to be contextualized in China’s modern history of dealing with refugee issues; (3) population politics, the rise of Han-centric nationalism, and their constraining impact on the interpretation of historical events related to cultural diversity. In conclusion, this article also offers potential implications for further examining the different yet potentially intersected genealogies of multicultural imaginaries beyond the Middle Eastern and North African refugees in Asia. © 2020 This is an Open Access paper distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works License."

Controversial cases of security related political communication, salient media enunciations, and social media reframing are explored through the theoretical lenses of securitization and cascading activation of framing in the contexts of Slovakia, Russia, and the United States. The first research question explores whether and how the frame element of moral evaluation factors into the conversations on the securitization of the pandemic. The analysis tracks the framing process through elite, media, and public levels of communication. The second research question focused on fairly controversial actors - ""rogue actors""- such as individuals linked to far-leaning political factions or militias. The proliferation of digital media provides various actors with opportunities to join publicly visible conversations. The analysis demonstrates that the widely differing national contexts offer different trends and degrees in securitization of the pandemic during spring and summer of 2020. The studied rogue actors usually have something to say about the pandemic, and frequently make some reframing attempts based on idiosyncratic evaluations of how normatively appropriate is their government's ""war""on COVID-19. In Slovakia, the rogue elite actors at first failed to have an impact but eventually managed to partially contest the dominant frame. Powerful Russian media influencers enjoy some conspiracy theories but prudently avoid direct challenges to the government's frame, and so far only marginal rogue actors openly advance dissenting frames. The polarized political and media environment in the US has shown to create a particularly fertile ground for rogue grassroots movements that utilize online platforms and social media, at times going as far as encouragement of violent acts to oppose the government and its pandemic response policy. © Lukacovic."

Through a critical discourse analysis of the book’s narrative and its many beauty-and fashion-based images, the article stresses how, having gained renown as a social media-based influ-encer and vlogger, Torkia’s book represents a remediated approach to communication practices of beauty and style advice. Hence, in a printed book form, Modestly consistently combines instruction with autobiographical content. In this regard, the article explores the differing ways that Modestly articulates expressions of Bourdieu’s concept of habitus in the context of modest Islamic fashion. This is explored in terms of the nature of the beauty and fashion instruction that is the main focus of the book, but also in how the autobiographical aspects of the text articulate Torkia’s self-reflections on cultural and sartorial habitus in relation to a Muslim lifestyle, modest dress and beauty conventions and changing perceptions and articu-lations of cultural hybridity and intersectional identity. © 2020 Intellect Ltd Article."

The latest example of this is the #IAFExplorers campaign of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF), looking for young super-influencers to attend the Global Space Exploration Conference GLEX 2020. Earlier we have seen successful events by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), SAR Galileo, NASA and ESA. In this paper we first describe how influencer marketing works in different industry sectors. We all know about how influencers have been working in big-marketing-budget sectors like sports, food, travel, gaming and fashion, but we are seeing increasing interest from other areas, including high tech, NGOs and government, and now space. After this generic marketing overview, we look into the learnings of influencer marketing campaigns in the space sector. We analyse the results of these campaigns, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We look into the statistics of some of these campaigns, but also interview the organisers and some of the influencers. We look at the real gains of the campaign, in relation to the costs and how to measure success? From this, we derive a list of campaign elements that work and elements that don't work. In the conclusion we then translate the key success factors into practical tips for influencer marketing for space organisations, with the aim to help NGOs, government agencies and commercial space companies to benefit from online influencers and avoid some of the pitfalls. In our presentation we want to share best practices with space marketeers and outreach teams, to benefit from the trend of influencer marketing in the most cost-effective way. © 2020 by DLR-SART."

Developing and keeping a large community of followers is one of the most important goals of influencers. The size of their audiences is one of the elements that make them relevant to the advertising industry. The main objective of the present research is to explore the mechanism that determines users’ online behavior related to influencers, such as following them on social media. Moreover, the study examined the role of the perceived information quality and of the perceived trust of the influencers in shaping audiences’ attitudes toward influencers. The moderating role of the frequency of Instagram and YouTube use on the relationship between perceived information quality and trustworthiness was explored by conducting an online survey (N=1088). The main takeaway from the study is that influencers who want to grow their audiences have to create perceived quality content. This can contribute to both positive attitudes and the development of trust. Also, the frequency of Instagram use has a small moderating role, while the frequency of YouTube use has no effects on the trustworthiness of the influencers. © 2020, National University of Political Studies and Public Administration.

We specifically refer to reports which reject the group's claims of leaderlessness, and indicate a fracturing of the group after the arrests of prominent members in 2011-2013. In our research, we present the first attempts to use machine learning to identify and analyse the presence of a network of over 20, 000 Anonymous accounts spanning from 2008-2019 on the Twitter platform. In turn, this research utilises social network analysis (SNA) and centrality measures to examine the distribution of influence within this large network, identifying the presence of a small number of highly influential accounts. Moreover, we present the first study of tweets from some of the identified key influencer accounts and, through the use of topic modelling, demonstrate a similarity in overarching subjects of discussion between these prominent accounts.

Instead of standing outside, she interrupts and disrupts Islamic fashion on Instagram by constantly bringing up concerns of body image, fatphobia, colorism, racism, economic inequality, and mental health. Leah’s intersectional feminist critique, I argue, gains power and visibility because of how she effectively interrupts the aesthetic style of Instagram by inserting her unruly body and her concern for social injustices. © 2020 (Kristin M.

Under this paradigm, the only potential problem caused by advertising is an individual consumer misled into purchasing something they would not otherwise. As such, for native advertising and influencer marketing, regulators recommend clear disclosure as the solution.

Design/Methodology/Approach – The study focused on the posts sampled from Croatian Instagram SMIs with more than ten thousand followers. Ten posts from each SMI were analysed for both low engagement, i.e. the number of likes, and high engagement, i.e. the number of comments, along with information on whether a face and other features of an SMI features were shown in a post. Findings and implications – Human face in a post increases engagement, but only the lower type (i.e. the number of likes a post receives), even when the effect of the number of followers is statistically controlled for. A higher type of engagement (i.e. the number of com-ments) is not affected by the presence of a face in a post. Limitations – A lack of formal operationalization of SMIs leads to a more conservative sample of only those SMIs with more than ten thousand followers. The content of the posts preceding the analysed post, which could have influenced the followers’ behaviour, could not be measured due to the study design. Originality – Although previous research has shown that a face in an Instagram post leads to more likes and comments among friends, the relationship between SMIs and their followers lacks the exact reciprocity of like-for-like. Given that the followers’ gains are not straightforward in this kind of relationship, the finding that a face shown in a post can affect engagement is worth scientific attention. © 2020, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb.

Mobile banking is one such technology which has gained immense acceptance amongst its consumers. However, there is a need to gain an insight of mobile users’ attitude towards mobile banking if it has to replace the traditional ways of banking in eternity. There is no denying to the fact that Social Media has played the role of an immensely powerful arbitrator in orienting consumers towards mobile banking. This conceptual paper thereby attempts to seek the role of Social Media towards various stages of consumers’ attitude in accepting such technologies such as mobile banking in India. Through this paper we intend to build a framework which identifies the role of social media in the transition of mobile banking consumers from one stage of cognitive process to the other. The work primarily addresses young consumers for their being the early influencers of social media.

The element listening, is crucial when creating content. Listening helps to discover the customer’s interests, so that an organisation can respond to this. The sub-elements of listening are: listening to influencers, listening to what is said about your brand and competitor, discovering channel preferences, discovering customer motives, and discovering customer interests. Listening allows organisations to determine several content characteristics that influences customer engagement. A case study is used in order to validate the use of the framework.

Within two months 5,520 cases had been reported and 79 deaths, the majority of them being children. The question arises as to why the disaster developed and what the contributing factors were. This paper proposes that one of the main explanations for the disaster – and also the recovery - lies in the power of social media and the actors in that arena. In particular, this research aimed to examine the relatively recent social media phenomenon of the influencer; to demonstrate the significant power of influencers as a reference group, either individually or in concert; and to demonstrate the potential danger of misinformation in the hands of influencers. Basic communication theory was used as the theoretical lens for the research. Thus the source or sender; the message; the media; and the receiver were all examined. Official documents, traditional media reports and social media postings were all included in the research. While measles vaccinations have always been available in Samoa, they were never mandatory. Vaccination rates plummeted to an all-time low when two children died from incorrectly administered vaccines. The deaths provided the anti-vax campaigners with the necessary fuel to argue their cause. In late 2019 when an outbreak of measles in New Zealand made its way to Samoa, the vaccination drive was heightened, although many remained skeptical and preferred traditional approaches. Social media are heavily used in Samoa and became the main channel for the anti-vaxxers’ opinions and exhortations. Prominent among these were a well-known and highly regarded traditional healer. Another significant influencer was a Samoan woman now living in Australia. In many regards she appears to be a Samoa’s own Kim Kardashian, and seems to hold commensurate sway. The exhortations of these influencers were severely condemned by many medical experts and bodies as misinformation. The high potential of fatalities if this misinformation was followed, posed a huge threat to Samoans. Ultimately the traditional healer was arrested and, as far as possible, the authorities cancelled the Samoan woman’s promotion initiatives. It was not until December 2019 when mandatory enforcement of vaccinations was finally introduced by the government under a state of emergency that the epidemic was brought under control. This paper highlights the huge power of social media, and the potentially disruptive – and even fatal – influence of influencers and misinformation. It serves to alert governments to be especially vigilant of social media activity and to have substantial social media plans in place, which consider the factors that might play an influential role in such a situation. © European Conference on Social Media, ECSM 2020."

Therefore, these platforms enable a company to connect and engage their customers through different types of content posts, including informational, social, remuneration, social responsibility, sponsored posts or influencer posts that are all accompanied with images, videos, links and polls. In addition, companies might engage customers with more sophisticated media type of posts, such as stories. To date, the majority of academic attention has been paid to the antecedents of customer engagement behaviour (CEB), which empower companies to develop their effective communication strategies on social media. Despite the increasing attention paid to CEB initiatives on social media, how it effects a company’s performance is largely ignored. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to add new insights into how a companys’s CEB initiatives influence the company’s social media performance and company performance. A structural equation modeling procedure was used to empirically test the model using a quantitative data set of Lithuanian companies (n=92). The results indicate that company CEB initiatives do not influence company’s social media performance and social media performance is not associated with company‘s performance. Interestingly, company CEB initiatives are related to company perfomance. The study contributes to the first attempts to investigate the impact of CEB initiatives on a company’s social media and marketing performance, however this needs to be replicated. © European Conference on Social Media, ECSM 2020."

The sheer volume of Covid-19 misinformation and disinformation (i.e. “mis-infodemic”), particularly on social media, encumbers evidence-based health communication, disease prevention and behaviour change interventions. For instance, the WHO collaboration centre at the University of Illinois determined that in March 2020, around 550 million tweets (3% of monthly tweets) included the terms/hashtags: covid-19, coronavirus, #Pandemic, #misinfodemic, and #FlattenTheCurve. Only some of the information on this and other social media platforms are accurate. Covid-19 mis-infodemic expands at the same pace as content production and distribution paths grow - social media network users grew from 0.97 billion at the end of 2010 to 3.8 billion by the second quarter of 2020. This Critical Review study examines the burden of Covid-19, the extent of Covid-19 mis-infodemic along the continuum of healthcare - Primary, Secondary and Tertiary - and approaches for assuring trustworthy information about covid-19 on social media platforms. Reinventing social media platforms as reliable health messaging and learning tools for Covid-19 requires major inputs from all stakeholders - regulatory activities of social media companies to address misleading content; greater prominence of accurate Covid-19 resources and support outlets on social media sites; self-regulation by politicians and social influencers with regards to the Covid-19 related statements and behaviours on social media, and; community-wide enhancement of digital literacy and health literacy to facilitate evaluation and appropriate application of Covid-19 information accessed from social media platforms. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

This experimental study assessed effects of sponsorship disclosures on perceptions of e-cigarette Instagram influencer posts. Methods: Young adult e-cigarette users (age 18-29; N = 917) were randomly assigned to 3 experimental conditions varying the clarity of sponsorship disclosure on simulated Instagram influencer posts: clear (eg, “#sponsored”), ambiguous (eg, “#sp”), or no disclosure (ie, vaping-related hashtags only). After viewing each of 4 Instagram posts featuring a fictitious e-cigarette brand, participants reported hashtag recognition, ad recognition, ad trust, influencer credibility, and post engagement intentions. After viewing all posts, participants reported brand attitudes, brand use intentions, and vaping intentions. Results: With greater recognition of clear (but not ambiguous) disclosure hashtags, ad recognition increased (p = .001), perceptions of influencer credibility decreased (p = .022), and intentions to engage with posts decreased (p = .008). Ad trust was lower with greater hashtag recognition regardless of disclosures (p < .001).

Previous researches find influential users based on follower or retweet relationships and centrality measurement approaches. In this paper, influential users are detected by network topology that was obtained from communication relationships among users, link analysis approach, and user's profile features. The proposed approach aims to detect trending topic influencers. Firstly, communication relationships namely retweet, mention, and reply between users in a trending topic are extracted and a trending topic graph is constructed. Secondly, influential users are detected using a link analysis approach combined with the ability of users’ profile features. The performance of the system can be proved to compare with influencer detection methods. The experimental result shows that the trending topic influencers can detect using the interaction relationships and user's features. © 1988 © 1988 ASBMB.

This is hardly surprising, as social influencers have the advantage to be generally perceived as authentic testimonials who can communicate in a customized way to the consumer target group. Certain social influencers can even attract a larger audience than an average television production. Thus, it is crucial to know the success factors of an influencer marketing campaign. Until now, research has mainly focused on global measures of success such as different measures of number of followers, pagerank, or retweets. However, practitioners sometimes state that these measures are too superficial. This presumption becomes further substantiated by numerous examples of social influencer campaigns that failed, although the endorser fulfilled the above mentioned criteria. Often, the reasons for these failures lie in a mismatch between influencer and brand. Hence, practitioners speculate that it would be relevant to consider the triad of (a) social influencer personality, (b) brand personality, and (c) consumer personality. An exemplary follow-up question may be whether it is important that the personality of the social influencer matches one of the brands. The work at hand picks up on this chain of thoughts: It investigates whether the interplay of (1) personality congruence between influencer and brand, (2) the identification of the consumer with the influencer, and (3) the level of product involvement have effects on constructs of brand perception (brand attitude, brand trust) and brand behavior (purchase intention). For this purpose, stimulus material in the form of social influencer profiles and posts endorsing two well-known brands. Hypothesizes testing occurs by means of structural equation modeling. The results indicate that (1) personality congruence between influencer and brand is the most important success factor, followed by (2) identification. (3) The level of product involvement is nearly insignificant. Based on these findings, implications for management and further research are developed. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

The findings suggest bodybuilders and trainers believe influencers are not authentic members of the subculture and instead are sexualized laborers. The findings also explicate a misunderstanding among bodybuilders and trainers about how social media use is a productive form of labor for influencers.

This is the first study to systematically examine leading cigar brands' use of influencers on their brand Instagram pages. Methods: We identified 24 leading cigar brands, using July 2017-June 2018 US retail data. We identified cigar brands that had official appearing Instagram pages, with at least one influencer in the past 20 posts. We coded characteristics of the past three posts from each of five brand pages that contained influencers, such as setting and what the influencer was doing. Finally, we described influencer characteristics. Results: Approximately one-third of the 24 brands had official Instagram accounts with at least one influencer in the past 20 posts. We identified 28 influencers, typically people of colour from the hip-hop music industry, some with millions of followers. Influencers included Bella Thorne (@bellathorne), Shaquille O'Neal (@shaq) and T.I. (@troubleman31). Brands' posts that contained influencers showed the influencer using/holding a product, wearing branded merchandise or appearing in photos with a brand watermark. Three brands' pages posted sponsored event photos (ie, concerts and events using branded backgrounds). Discussion: Cigar brands commonly use influencers to market their products on brand Instagram pages. Results are consistent with previous findings that cigar companies' marketing may target younger African Americans and highlight the potential utility of education campaigns that similarly engage influencers. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

In CarecaTV, cancer subjectivity co-exists with and is expressed through digital commercialization. On the one hand, through this process, Lorena Reginato gains agency as she offers an inspirational and credible first-person testimony about cancer during childhood and becomes an emerging cancer activist. On the other, she uses entrepreneurship strategies associated with the digital influencer model of YouTube to promote herself as a (cancer) micro-celebrity, taking the lead in a youthful and playful culture. © The Author(s) 2020."

Therefore, this paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that hypothesises the effect of social media influencer and advertising value on attitude and brand love, specifically in the context of Malaysia’s national car. This paper highlighted the importance of the roles and credibility of social media influencer as ‘user specific effect’ which are predicted to influence consumer attitude. In addition, the social media advertising values, which refer as ‘content effect’ also play essential roles in shaping the consumer attitude. Both effects are measured for their relationship with a consumer attitude towards social media video and as well as consumer attitude towards the selected brands, which at the end affecting brand love.

To test the model, a survey questionnaire was administered among 404 Instagram users who have visited a destination of choice Instagram page. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was undertaken to assess the dimensionality and validity of the measurement scale. The study used a path modelling technique to test the proposed hypotheses. The results of structural equation modelling (AMOS 25) indicated that the relationship between exposure to influencer advertising and brand belief was robust. However, exposure to influencer advertising showed a moderate positive effect on both advertising cognition and attitude towards the destination. Consequently, attitude towards the advertising (Ad), brand beliefs and brand attitude had a significant and positive effect on destination visit intention.

This study sets to describe how social media influences the buying intentions of Wearable Devices (WD). In doing so, constructs from Information Acceptance Model (IACM) had been compared to the resulting themes from 9 one-on-one interview responses and a relationship between social media and wearable devices was formed. Objectives: Primary objectives were to determine the relationship between social media and; (i) WD sales, (ii) WD features and application information (iii) ongoing interactions on WD’s. Secondary objectives were to determine (i) if the availability of a WD affected the volume of social media interactions and (ii) if the value associated with a WD was related to the social media posts of that device. Design, Methodology, and Approach: This study took a qualitative approach to research and used phenomenology as a stance of exploring social media’s influence on purchase intentions towards the wearable device. A positivist philosophical standpoint was applied to deduce themes from the ICAM by touching on interpretivism elements in analyzing the data collected from semi-structured interviews. The data was then categorized into themes, refined into sub-themes and then assessed according to the research propositions as well as the ICAM frameworks constructs. Findings: Social media was viewed more of as an information outlet as opposed to a driver of purchase intention. From this, it was seen that word of mouth was the biggest driver in WD awareness. Information Quality, Attitudes towards information were the main influencers that social media has towards purchase intention from the ICAM model. This was evident in the construct scores which showed that there was a relationship between the adoption of social media information and purchase intention, that there is a relationship between the features of a WD and social media usage as well as showing that there is a relationship between the users’ perception of the type of social media platform and the WD presented on that platform.

In Qatar, due to lack of trust, an only small percentage of Qatari populations has shown an interest in mobile shopping although the average annual individual’s expenditure is impressive. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate antecedents of consumer’ trust in the context of mobile commerce [1]. The objective of this paper is to explore whether trust perceptions towards mobile shopping among diverse segments of consumers living in Qatar vary significantly or not by proposing a conceptual framework for trust based on the Technology Acceptance Model. An online survey was conducted to empirically validate the newly developed trust factors between consumers with different nationalities, genders, and age ranges by performing permutations and partial lease squares multi-group analysis algorithms. Our research findings revealed that nationalities differences related to the factor perceived usability had positive indirect effect on Qataris trust, female consumers’ trust could be enhanced by perceived usability, and young consumers could easily trust mobile commerce via the endorsement of social media influencers. The results also emphasized that perceived security was one of the most significant factors that affect drastically mobile commerce trust between all groups of consumers. We ended our work offering some valuable theoretical implications for scholars and interesting strategies for practitioners to help to create customer’s trust especially during crises, such as COVID-19. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

Intrigued by the phenomenal success of ecommerce livestream, we concentrate on analyzing the most prominent and illustrative example of Chinese ecommerce live-streamer Austin Li. Through this individual case study, we aim to investigate discursive strategies employed in ecommerce livestreaming and reveal resources specific to this new media genre. Guided by multimodal discourse analysis, our research first accommodates the socio-economic context of Li’s success to warrant social situatedness in interpreting data. After that we move into analyzing his discourse employed in livestreaming. Research findings suggest that in attention economy, Li strategically utilizes his male gender as a resource in trying on lipsticks for female customers. His discourse in multiple modes serves to build consumer trust and propagate products. An in-depth analysis of his discursive strategies indicates that, ecommerce livestreaming as a new form of advertising not only shares commonalities with traditional advertisement discourse but also embodies affordances that are specific to livestreaming platforms. To be more specific, livestreaming is featured with delimitation of time, real-time interactivity, and video-aided communication. These affordances enable Li to adopt more interactive and personalized persuasive discourse than conventional advertisements. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

The CA-based model allows the examination of various scenarios with different hypotheses in the context of water resources management in Egypt. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is applied to test the robustness of the model’s results. The empirical results show that both social media posts as well as the fear of building the Renaissance Dam in Ethiopia play a motivational role to encourage the individuals to conserve water in Egypt. This is supported by the effort of the most effective and influential categories (family, friends, and relatives, according to the results of the current study) because they are identified as the major influencers on the surrounding people in their social networks.

However, little research has focused on the role of pictorial types on social media influencers and brands. Thus, this study explores how different combinations of advertising-disclosure conditions and pictorial types can affect social media influencer credibility and consumers’ brand attitudes. By using an experimental 3 × 2 between-subject design, we collected data from 264 followers of beauty influencers on Weibo. Results revealed that a post that disclosed sponsorship significantly decreased influencer credibility and consumers’ brand attitudes compared to a post without any disclosure. Results also showed that a post with no-sponsorship disclosure significantly increased influencer credibility and consumers’ brand attitudes than a post without any disclosure or a post disclosing sponsorship. With regard to pictorial types, the influencer-with-product type led to higher influencer credibility and more positive brand attitudes in consumers than the product-only type in all three disclosure conditions. This study highlights the role of pictorial types in strengthening the power of advertising-disclosure language, which can further affect influencer credibility and consumers’ brand attitudes.

In the Network young people lead their social life, search for information on various topics and also watch social networking sites, where so-called influencers i.e. network celebrities run their thematic profiles. Content posted by influencers is not always valuable and it happens that they cross the law line and push the boundaries of good taste. An example can be currently popular “patostreams” i.e. live broadcasts, during which behaviors considered as social deviations are presented such as domestic violence, alcohol libations or vulgar discussions. The goal of influencers is to arouse interest in their profile in social media which translates into the number of followers and in turn is supposed to contribute followers’ decisions (e.g. shopping) and opinions on the topics presented. Young people, who have no experience and critical overview and their maturity is just developing, often spend many hours a week in the virtual space watching influencer messages.

This paper is concerned with the question of whether the social networking functions can definitely help the e-commerce websites establish their social commerce. To answer this question, this study develops an analysis framework that incorporates four tasks: (1) explore the small-world and power-law properties of the friendship networks constructed by users of e-commerce websites, (2) detect homophily, (3) investigate social influence occurring among users, and (4) build a profile for the influencers in the network. Employing the framework to conduct an empirical analysis on the Yelp dataset, we gained insights into social commerce on Yelp, which reveals that the social networking functions do not work well and social commerce occurs only in a small user group. This study also shows a clear route by which Yelp can improve its social commerce, i.e., by encouraging more users to build friendships and by promoting users to use the social networking functions. © 2020 California State University, Long Beach."

Analysing user-generated content, it shows how the platform creates dispositions towards certain forms of self-presentation through the interactions between influencers and common users. In particular, this contribution argues that the practice of tagging/hashtagging brands, mediated by influencer marketing, has penetrated the social tissue of the platform to such an extent that common users have come to appropriate a set of pre-established self-presentation narratives tailored by neoliberal rationalities over evaluative practices. The article concludes by claiming that branding practices undertaken by Instagram users can be understood not only as a form of structural labour but also as a form of subjective labour that, due to the nature of the social media milieu, enlarges the space of an ideological environment by reaching an ever-growing number of users. © 2020, Unified Theory of Information Research Group.

Methodology: It was mainly quantitative and descriptive with data collection through Social Blade and Fan Page Karma monitoring tools, which provided information about the activity and engagement of influencers on Instagram and the main variables of interaction. We conducted a cross-sectional study on ten accounts of Spanish-speaking fashion instagrammers (Latin America-Spain) during February in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Results: The level of engagement of Latin American Instagrammers is prominent compared to Spain. There is no relation between the numbers of followers and the commitment registered for both cases; there are notable variations and similar trends in the fashion sector.

Youtube as the number 1 social media in Indonesia, has an important role as a promotional strategy media for beauty products. Research design, data and methodology: This study used the online survey to 210 female respondents aged 17-30 years who became a subscriber of an Indonesian beauty influencer. Simple regression and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the independent variables towards the dependent variable. Results: The results show that social media influencer, electronic word of mouth, and perceived quality simultaneously have a significant influence on purchase intention. Nevertheless, only two variables individually have a significant influence on purchase intention, which is social media influencer and perceived quality. Conclusions: Perceived quality and social media influencer could be the best strategies to increase consumers when promoting through the influencer's Youtube channel by utilizing a subscriber. While e-WOM can be influential on other social media platforms rather than on the Youtube platform. Therefore, suggested that digital marketer must use multiple social media platforms to increase consumers' purchase intention. © The Author(s)."

The video by the popular German YouTuber Rezo attacked the conservative Government party CDU (Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands) mainly for climate inaction. As a reaction to the subsequent attacks on Rezo and his video from the political establishment an alliance of popular German YouTubers formed to release a second video. In this video, the YouTubers asked their followers not to vote for the Government or the far-right parties, because they would ignore the expertise of scientists and the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and therefore be unable to provide sustainable solutions for the future. This debate started as a YouTube phenomenon but quickly evolved into a national public discussion that took place across various social media channels, blogs, newspapers, and TV news, but also e.g., in discussions in schools, churches, as well as arts and cultural events. The focus of this contribution is on the formation of the heterogeneous coalition that emerged to defend and support the YouTubers. It prominently involved scientists and scientific expertise, but other forms of expertise and ‘worlds of relevance’ were also part of this coalition. The conceptual tools of ‘networked expertise’ and ‘ethno-epistemic assemblages’ are employed to explore expertise and credibility as well as the associations and networks of actors involved which illuminate how a single YouTuber was able to contribute to the unleashing of a national debate on climate change policy. © 2020 by the author;."

Facebook may have been the social media that connects people around the world with massive cultural backgrounds to meet at the platform. The media content uploaded may spark the invasion of culture.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 288 participants completed an online survey evaluating the profiles of influencers who varied in terms of the three abovementioned requirements. The impacts of these requirements on brand image, brand satisfaction and brand trust as well as purchase intention and price premium were tested via structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that the most important requirement is trustworthiness, followed by attractiveness; surprisingly, the relevance of expertise is virtually nil. Research limitations/implications: To date, practitioners are still struggling with the success requirements of influencer marketing. They have focused on traditional advertising models and numeric requirements such as the amount of followers. However, regarding merely these requirements can result in wrong decisions. Considering the two requirements, attractiveness and trustworthiness, in a stronger way can provide a remedy to this struggle. In future research, the relevance of the requirements in different involvement conditions and for non-attractiveness-related products might be investigated. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first to explore the success requirements that are directly related to influencers (e.g. attractiveness) rather than numeric requirements of their profiles (e.g. page rank) and the impacts of those requirements on brand image, brand satisfaction and brand trust as well as purchase intention and price premium. It adapts the Source-Credibility Model for influencers and shows that its requirements interact in a unique way that is counterintuitive and different from other endorser types such as celebrities or salespersons. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Based on three studies across two product categories, our findings suggest that mainstream celebrities were more effective endorsers than social media influencers in both a celebrity-product congruent and incongruent condition. Endorsement effectiveness was explained by the strength of the parasocial relationship that Indian consumers developed with celebrities and social media influencers. In a materialistic country like India, as celebrities possess more wealth, power, and status, consumers formed a stronger parasocial relationship with them than social media influencers. Regulatory focus moderated this relationship such that, for promotion-focused consumers, no difference existed in the strength of the parasocial relationship between consumers and celebrities versus social media influencers. However, for prevention-focused consumers, the strength of the parasocial relationship increased for mainstream celebrities and decreased for social media influencers. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Miquela is the first digitally created virtual influencer. This paper provides an initial analysis of some of the ontological and ethical issues associated with the rise of virtual influencers on social media platforms like Instagram. Through a focus on Miquela, it is argued that while these fabricated identities may cause uneasiness at first, there is nothing morally significant that distinguishes them from natural, 'real life' influencers. But, far from 'business as usual', the inability to separate 'virtual' and 'real life' influencers raises important questions about the ethical construction of identity, and how this may affect the ongoing preservation of social values like trust in online spaces. The paper draws on literature in personal identity and agency theory to establish the ontological claim that there is no meaningful difference between Miquela and other 'real life' influencers, which leads to the discussion about ethical issues including moral responsibility and motivation, and transparency. As of May 2020, this appears to be the first peer-reviewed article theorising about virtual influencers. There are significant opportunities for further research, both in terms of how we should conceptualise these identities, as well as more empirically based social research into how to preserve social values like trust in online spaces. © 2020 Robinson."

This is particularly true for tourism, which is undergoing significant changes due to the development of new technologies. The level of technology diffusion depends on several factors like the exchange of information among peers, and the attitude and shared perception among the contributors. The aim of the study is to explore the diffusion of technology in tourism with a specific focus on the social media discourse around new technologies. Thus, the paper investigates the level of interest in these new technologies analysing the information exchange occurring between individuals on Twitter in order to explore the influence of reciprocal networking. Design/methodology/approach: To capture the attitudes expressed in the industry, the study analyses the ongoing discourse on Twitter as a proxy for the participants “interest in new technologies. Through a social network analysis of the tweets and retweets conducted over a period of nine months, the research maps the level of information exchange about the diffusion of new technologies. Moreover, the sentiment analysis provides an interesting overview of the individuals” attitudes towards the awareness or the adoption of new technologies. Findings: Our analysis has provided several insights: (1) the information network on blockchain in tourism consists of participants who change very quickly over time (high turnover of accounts); (2) some contributors have an extremely important role in influencing the flow of information in the system (information centralization), they can have a generalist (discussing several topics) or a specialist (focusing on a specific topic) behaviour and this strategic choice influences their network's structure; (3) these central nodes also have an impact on the definition of positive and negative sentiment towards a topic (sentiment influencer). Research limitations/implications: The paper contributes to the literature on technology diffusion, by focusing on one of the preconditions of diffusion that is the shared positive attitude towards technological innovation. More specifically, we adopt a network-based approach, which is useful to explain the level of information exchange and the public discourse that can impact the shared perception and attitude towards technological innovation. The study also highlights the role of knowledge brokers in influencing this public discourse. Future studies can deepen the association between positive perception, higher levels of information exchange and increasing usage of specific technologies. Our results also suggest further exploring the opportunity to combine social media data and other sources of information to shed more light on the technological innovation diffusion processes. Practical implications: This paper shows how practitioners can benefit from the analysis of information exchange about new technologies in tourism adopting a network perspective with the aim of understanding the level of influence among contributors. Moreover, the increasing interest in blockchain technology and the potential combination between social media data and other sources of information can offer promising insights. Social implications: The present study explores the level of technology diffusion through the analysis of information exchange on social media (Twitter). Furthermore, the dynamics of individual user behaviour offers a better understanding about media effects. Originality/value: While previous research is focused on the users' perception towards the development of new technologies in tourism, the aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics behind the level of diffusion of information and awareness about these new technologies, which still represents an unexplored area of research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

These platforms are utilized for many reasons, such as business promotion. Although beneficial, social media can cause ethical dilemmas if used incorrectly. Objectives: A review of the literature revealed what is understood about the implications of social media in regards to sponsorship/promotion. This paper aimed to create the foundation surrounding this topic and help facilitate future discussions on this new ethical dilemma. Methods: A MEDLINE search with a custom publication date range and a review of the literature was conducted on June 15, 2019. Results: The search yielded 139 articles and abstracts. After review, 26 publications were chosen for analysis. Articles were taken from the following journals: Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (n = 12), Aesthetic Surgery Journal (n = 8), PRS Global Open (n = 2), Annals of Plastic Surgery (n = 1), BMJ (n = 1), AMA Journal of Ethics (n = 1), and Facial Plastic Surgery (n = 1).

A quantitative content analysis is used on 2,588 tweets disseminated during the November 2019 general election campaign in Spain by them. Results show differences between the different types of actors who make up the sample.

With this in mind, the main objective of this research is to explore the influence of the far-right in the public debate of political leaders on Twitter, analyzing the specific case of the Andalusian regional elections held in December 2018. These elections can be considered a political turning point, with an extreme right party winning seats in a Spanish regional election for the first time in 35 years.

This is why many companies and institutions are positioning their executives-using their full names– to build loyalty amongst their diverse client base. On the other hand, the reputation strategy known as “CEO Executive Visibility” aims to promote a brand by putting the spotlight on its top management and aligning their character traits with the values that the organisation wishes to transmit, thus capturing new audiences, improving follower loyalty and generating more engagement. Along these lines, and using content analysis and quantitative research methods, and combining economic and communication factors as theoretical underpinnings, this investigation examines how the chairpersons of the companies listed in the Ibex 35 (the Spanish benchmark index) use the main social networks (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube and personal blogs). The results obtained show how executive visibility strategies are applied in Spain and who the main influencers in this financial environment are. This research evidences that the chairpersons of Ibex 35 companies do not post consistently on social media and that there is a link between the public image of a company’s top management and the perception of a company and its commitment to its audience. © 2020 Communication & Society."

This research attempts to understand the mechanism of influencer campaigning in the mobile game industry. The research model proposes that influencer marketing affects purchase intention in two key ways: direct triggering and indirect amplification. The study empirically tests the model using mobile game influencer campaigns conducted on YouTube. A case study is presented to support the proposed direct triggering effect. For the indirect amplification effect, statistical tests were performed using additional marketing and purchase data. The results suggest that influencer marketing has huge and timely impacts on the revenue of game companies early on, but the effects diminish quickly. Within the domain of game apps, influencer marketing not only has a direct impact on the purchase intention of viewers, but also indirectly amplifies the purchase intention of non-viewers through brand visibility and brand awareness. © Henry Stewart Publications 2050-0076 (2020)."

Suicide is one of these dangerous emotions that threaten the public health of Canadians, and mortality form suicide is the third leading cause of death in teenage. In this paper, we propose a suicide classifier system called Auto Twitter Suicide Detector System (ATSDS) that provides support to authorities to take appropriate actions in order to protect communities from such kind of thoughts. The proposed twitter suicide detector system is a classifier system using data gathered from twitter to detect those related to suicide.

Quality is not a prerequisite for viral spreading, yet large diffusion cascades remain the hallmark of a social influencer. Consequently, our exposure to low-quality content and questionable influence is expected to increase. Since the conception of influence maximization frameworks, multiple content performance metrics became available, albeit raising the complexity of influence analysis. In this paper, we examine and consolidate a diverse set of content engagement metrics. The correlations discovered lead us to propose a new, more holistic, one-dimensional engagement signal. We then show it is more predictable than any individual influence predictors previously investigated. Our proposed model achieves strong engagement ranking performance and is the first to explain half of the variance with features available early. We share the detailed numerical workflow to compute the new compound engagement signal. The model is immediately applicable to social media monitoring, influencer identification, campaign engagement forecasting, and curating user feeds.

Drawing on source credibility theory and persuasion research, aim of this study is to understand the interactive and distinct role of source and message credibility of eWOM towards consumer's brand attitude. Brand attitude may be influenced differently by different levels and combinations of source and content (message) credibility. Using the Facebook interface 246 between subject factorial design experiments are conducted. Two-way interaction effect of source and message credibility over consumer's brand attitude is tested; further one-way analysis of variance is tested to examine the varying influence of different levels and combinations of source and message credibility. A significant two-way interaction of source and message credibility moderate brand attitude.

Methods: Symplur, a Twitter analytics service, was used to analyze activity, users and tweet content for #MaleInfertility between August 2015 and November 2018. Activity was quantified by monthly tweets and yearly cumulative users. Users were classified based on geography, occupation and organizational affiliation. Content analysis was undertaken by analyzing retweets, links, media, mentions, replies, frequently used words and hashtags. Results: A total of 11,325 tweets and 3,241 users using #MaleInfertility were identified. Most tweets (73%) were sent with links. The average ± SD number of #MaleInfertility tweets per month increased from 152 ± 47 in 2015 to 439 ± 2,013 in 2018 (p <0.001). The number of users increased from 95 to 3,241 during this period. Linear regression revealed that the #MaleInfertility discussion increased by 8.7 tweets per month and 80 users per month across the study period (p <0.0001). Users tweeted from 22 countries and doctors comprised 39% of the top 100 influencers. Popular associated hashtags included #Infertility, #IVF and #Sperm. Tweet content codification revealed that tweets were mainly focused on providing online patient support. Conclusions: Twitter discussions focused on male infertility are increasing in volume. Our analysis highlights that doctors and organizations associated with health care are the primary influencers of #MaleInfertility Twitter discussions. This increase in users and tweet volume highlights that Twitter is an emerging digital tool to disseminate information about male infertility online. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Health communication campaigns can be effective in changing tobacco-related attitudes, intentions, and behaviors and can be used to address tobacco use inequities by targeting young people who are at high risk for tobacco use. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration launched Fresh Empire, the first tobacco public education campaign designed to reach primarily African American, Hispanic, and/or Asian American/Pacific Islander youth ages 12 to 17 years who identify with the Hip-Hop peer crowd. This article presents an overview of two targeting strategies—(a) influencers on social media and (b) paid digital and social media advertisements—that Fresh Empire uses to reach its audience and increase message credibility that can inform future campaigns targeting hard-to-reach populations. These strategies help the campaign expand its reach, be authentic, and increase engagement with the target audience. Microinfluencers are selected for their alignment with Hip-Hop values and high engagement rates; local influencers are teens recruited to promote the campaign in their communities; and digital and social ads are purchased with a minimum number of in-target guaranteed impressions. Across both strategies, metrics have met or exceeded expectations, including a sentiment analysis that revealed 87.3% of comments on microinfluencer posts were positive. Initial findings suggest that the tobacco prevention messages have reached the target population and resonated positively, which may help to increase message credibility and improve receptivity to tobacco prevention messages. © 2019 Society for Public Health Education."

Of the tweets, 66% were categorized as positive statements and 34% were categorized as negative. Conclusion: Social media is an emerging tool of communication in urology, whereas discussions on #Incontinence are underrepresented compared to the high prevalence of urinary incontinence. In addition, patients’ activity is low. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

We designed this study to determine if an association exists between conference attendance/registration and 4 defined Twitter metrics. METHODS: Using publicly available data through the Symplur Healthcare Hashtags Project and the Symplur Signals, we collected data on total tweets, impressions, retweets, and replies as 4 primary outcome metrics for all registered anesthesiology conferences occurring from May 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017. The number of Twitter participants, defined as users who contributed a tweet, retweet, or reply 3 days before through 3 days after the conference, was collected. We also collected influencer data as determined by mentions (number of times a user is referenced). Two authors independently verified the categories for influencers assigned by Symplur. Conference demographic data were obtained by e-mail inquiries. Associations between meeting attendees/registrants and Twitter metrics, between Twitter participants and the metrics, and between physician influencers and Twitter participants were tested using Spearman rho. RESULTS: Fourteen conferences with 63,180 tweets were included. With the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting included, the correlations between meeting attendance/registration and total tweets (rs = 0.588; P = .074), impressions (rs = 0.527; P = .117), and retweets (rs = 0.539; P = .108) were not statistically significant; for replies, it was moderately positive (rs = 0.648; P = .043). Without the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, total tweets (rs = 0.433; P = .244), impressions (rs = 0.350; P = .356), retweets (rs = 0.367; P = .332), and replies (rs = 0.517; P = .154) were not statistically significant. Secondary outcomes include a highly positive correlation between Twitter participation and total tweets (rs = 0.855; P&lt; .001),very highly positive correlations between Twitter participation and impressions (rs = 0.938; P &lt; .001), retweets (rs = 0.925; P &lt; .001), and a moderately positive correlation between Twitter participation and replies (rs = 0.652; P = .044). Doctors were top influencers in 8 of 14 conferences, and the number of physician influencers in the top 10 influencers list at each conference had a moderately positive correlation with Twitter participation (rs = 0.602; P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that the number of Twitter participants for a conference is positively associated with Twitter activity metrics. No relationship between conference size and Twitter metrics was observed. Physician influencers may be an important driver of participants. Copyright © 2019 International Anesthesia Research Society"

Yet, these discourses can be overwhelming and heated, in particular when controversial events happen. In this study, we performed topic modeling on more than 100,000 original tweets to examine Twitter discourses around Gillette's controversial cause-related marketing in 2019 and conducted network analysis through exponential random graph models (ERGM) to investigate the homophily tendency of users who used certain hashtags. Results show that users' discourses were mostly within the message frameworks of the campaign but users strongly reacted to others and top influencers in their online discussions. In addition, the mention network of these users showed homophily tendency based on hashtags. Homophily in this study was distinguished based on attraction of common users (i.e. increased chance of ties for users who both engage the hashtag) and alienation of nonusers (i.e. decreased chance of ties for users neither of whom engages the hashtag), and the comparison between ideological hashtags and conceptual hashtags revealed that homophily only manifested through ideological hashtags. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

The study explores performances of sexualized labour on social media by analysing visual and textual content from 172 female influencers on Instagram. This article contributes to the literature on sexualized labour in three ways. First, by demonstrating how sexualized labour is enacted across various forms of influencer labour, and how this relates to the attention economy and monetization.

As role models, they have the potential to play a crucial role in the identity construction of their viewers. In the age of social media, such role models may now be found more locally – in the same city – and perhaps with more diverse backgrounds. This may be particularly valuable to adolescents growing up in super-diverse cities, as they are surrounded by a multitude of groups and identities during a life phase in which they have to make sense of who they are and where they belong. Despite the heterogeneity of these identities, there is one thing all have in common: the city they live in. With the city as a common framework, local influencers may be important role models for these adolescents, particularly in negotiating their urban identity. This paper aims toward mapping the ways in which social media can play a role in the negotiation of urban identity among youngsters by investigating how YouTube influencers from a super-diverse city are related to each other online, and how their content relates to the (super-diverse) city of Rotterdam. Findings show that in their videos and on their channel pages, influencers mainly affiliate themselves with the city through having the city as the background and context of the videos, through their involvement with cultural trends (e.g., soccer, hip-hop) that link to the city, and through their affiliation with other local influencers. We argue that influencers may therefore provide their viewers with content that may potentially help their local viewers strengthen their urban identity. © Copyright © 2019 van Eldik, Kneer, Lutkenhaus and Jansz."

Brands are taking advantage of this fact and actively using social media to reach adolescent consumers, primarily via social media influencers. Adolescents consider the sponsored brand posts by social media influencers to be trustworthy and honest, thus reducing their critical evaluation of the ads. While several researchers have pointed to the critical role that parents play in their adolescents becoming digitally literate and empowered, there is little understanding of parental views and drivers of parental views on social media influencers and means by which they mediate their adolescents’ exposure to social media influencers. Our specific research questions are the following: (a) How does parents’ use of social media relate to their attitudes toward and mediation of social media influencers? (b) What is the role of psychological empowerment in enabling the relationship? Through a survey of approximately 200 mothers of adolescents (between the ages of 11 and 17 years), we examine how parents’ social media usage (active or passive) is related to their views toward social media influencers and mediation of social media influencers. We find that active (vs. passive) use of social media by parents led them to significantly (vs. not significantly) mediate social media influencers’ impact. Passive (vs. active) use of social media led to parents having a significant (vs. not significant) positive view of social media influencers. We explain this direct relationship by the level and kind of psychological empowerment (intrapersonal or interactional) that a parent experiences. Intrapersonal empowerment is related to self-efficacy, perceived competence, and desire for control, whereas interactional empowerment is related to an individual’s engagement in collective action and interactions with others. We find that active use of parental mediation increases intrapersonal empowerment resulting in parental mediation of social media influencers but has no effect on their positive or negative views on social media influencers. Moreover, passive use of social media results in interactional empowerment but has no significant impact on parental mediation but is related to positive views of social media influencers. Implications for regulators, practitioners, and parents are then discussed. © Copyright © 2019 Lin, Vijayalakshmi and Laczniak."

These vloggers regularly post attractive and entertaining content in the hope of building a large follower base. Although many of these vloggers are adults, the number of child vloggers is flourishing. The famous child vlogger Ryan of Ryan’s World, for instance, has more than 19 million viewers and he is (at age seven) a social media influencer. The popularity of these vloggers incited advertisers to include them as a new marketing communication tool, also referred to as influencer marketing, in their marketing strategy. Accordingly, many influential vloggers now receive free products from brands in return for a mention in one of their videos and their other social media (e.g., TikTok or Instagram) and some are even paid to create a sponsored post or video and distribute it to their followers. This sponsored content appears to be highly influential and may affect young children’s brand preferences. Given the limited advertising literacy skills (i.e., knowledge of advertising and skills to critically reflect on this advertising) of children under age 12, they are a vulnerable target group when it comes to persuasion. Therefore, caution is needed when implementing this marketing tactic to target them. However, research on how influencer marketing affects young children (under 12) is scarce and it is unclear how these young children can be empowered to critically cope with this fairly new form of persuasion. This paper therefore aims to shed light on why and how social media influencers have persuasive power over their young followers. The paper starts with providing insights into how and why social media influencers became a new source in advertising. We then discuss the few studies that have been conducted on influencer marketing among young children (under 12), based on a systematic literature review, and take these findings to formulate societal and policy implications and develop a future research agenda. © Copyright © 2019 De Veirman, Hudders and Nelson."

We then use these attributes to predict opinion leaders during the event. Our results provide support for the legitimacy of the last three dimensions. Specifically, we suggest that opinion leaders rely on information seeking, rather than social standing, and use their expertise to exert influence. Also, we claim that opinion leaders occur in the early stages of social events. This work is novel, as we apply social impact theory to modeling informational social impact from influencer's perspective. Finally, we provide theoretical and practical implications. © 2019 IEEE."

It is shown that prior to a polarization event a trend towards a more uniform distribution of relative influence is achieved which is then reversed by the polarization event. The reasons for this reversal are discussed and how it has a plausible analogue in real world systems.

Situating the case: The subReddit KotakuInAction is a well-known hub of the GamerGate community on Reddit, but one that has avoided the bans common to other aggressive subReddits and GamerGate communities on platforms such as 4chan and GitHub. We contextualize the aggressive nature of the subReddit and the reasons why participants' uses of metatags are meaningful for understanding subReddit culture and moderation practices. Methodology: To better understand the destructive behavioral patterns of KotakuInAction, we coded for the frequency of certain behaviors, such as linking and tagging, as well as the shift in certain keywords and vocabularies between the front facing or predetermined tags and the user-customized or admin-Altered tags. We also examined how tags shifted over time and whether certain users dominated particular tags. About the case: What we found was a hybrid culture on KiA that applied Chan culture values and flaming, but increasingly localized the behavior to KiA rather than direct readers out of the site. We also found key shifts in topics away from gaming and activism toward broader complaints about social justice. In addition, we found that a tiny core group of nine influencers (out of tens of thousands of users) accounted for 20% of the top conversations. Conclusions: We suggest a closer examination of how communities self-organize around meta naming structures. Knowledge of this activity can help with predicting and engaging with aggressive and hostile communities by describing how topics shift over time, how they adapt to platform moderation, and who the influencers within a community might be. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

This article expands the existing body of knowledge by providing insights into the dimensions of an experienced tourist. By treating the level of experience as an outcome rather than as an antecedent and giving a voice to the overlooked supply-side of tourism, this exploratory study contributes new findings to tourism scholarship. Findings are drawn from 15 semi-structured interviews with representatives from German and New Zealand destination management organisations. The findings challenge the previous narrow definition of an experienced tourist, which was based on only a few quantifiable factors. Specifically, the findings demonstrate that being classified as an experienced tourist is a complex, multidimensional and intertwined phenomenon based on eight dimensions that can be summarised as personal identifiers and external facilitators. The study highlights the importance of secondary experiences passively consumed through other people's eyes. It also sheds light onto the dual role of digital narratives as being both a tool for influencing tourists (sociological perspective) and for use by tourists to become influencers themselves (marketing perspective). Considering the growing importance of social influencers and the emergence of influencer marketing, this is a relevant finding with important implications for tourism practitioners and opens avenues for future research in other locations. © 2019 CAUTHE - COUNCIL FOR AUSTRALASIAN TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY EDUCATION"

The results from a sample of 280 followers show that the perceived influential power of digital influencers not only helps to generate engagement but also increases expected value and behavioral intention regarding the recommended brands. Moreover, brand engagement in self-concept raises brand expected value and both variables also affect the intention to purchase recommended brands.

Abdallah Al Maghlouth, Abdulrahman Mohammed, and Laila Hzaineh were selected for this study because they were listed among the top MENA influencers by the Arab Social Media Summit (2015) or by Stepfeed.1 The article draws on the cultural hybridity perspective to demonstrate how these influencers articulate cultural identity across three themes: human engagement, women‟s empowerment, and cultural revivalism. Cultural hybridity gained prominence within a range of cultural and social theories beginning in the 1980s. Recently, it has come to be interchangeably used with Robertson‟s notion of „glocalization‟ (Robertson 2012). Hybridity is a dynamic process necessary for cultural co-existence, continuity and for reconciling global sets of values with local (dominantly Arab-Islamic) social norms. Identity is informed by aspects of belonging or not to social groups; cyberspace is a new frontier for shaping and renewing social identities in the Middle East, with the majority of the population under 25 years and great levels of internet penetration, it is important to examine emerging sense of self and groups amongst Arab youth in cyberspace. © 2019, American University in Cairo.

Recent social media advancements have provided food marketers with platforms to reach out to many in more personal and authentic ways as compared to classical media advertising. Such personalized and borderless social media platforms allow marketers to easily use owned, paid, and earned (word-of –mouth) marketing strategies, including paid and non-paid influencers to reach younger target audiences. This study therefore aims to explore food messages adolescents (12–18 years old) encounter on social media, and assess these messages for their sources, the presence of core and non-core food, and the marketing strategies employed. To attain an in-depth understanding of the food messages that adolescents are continuously exposed to, we carried out a diary study with 21 Flemish adolescents who took screenshots of food images they encountered on their social media platforms for the duration of one week. A quantitative and qualitative content analysis of 611 images revealed that adolescents are mostly exposed to messages of non-core (67% of images) and branded (49% of images) food, often (49% of images) presented in association with a social context such as hanging around with friends, eating at restaurants and celebrating with food. Adolescents often encounter branded food images through peers and social media influencers, the majority of which are part of earned (49% of branded images) or paid (40% of branded images) media food marketing. This research provides an in-depth understanding of the social media messages that adolescents encounter on a daily basis and sheds light on food norms typically communicated on social media by marketers, peers, and influencers. Study findings highlight prominent social media food messages that should be tested for their persuasiveness, providing insights for future research that aims to assess the effects of social media food marketing on adolescents. Based on the study findings, we call for relevant policy actions that address current social media marketing strategies targeted at adolescents. © Copyright © 2019 Qutteina, Hallez, Mennes, De Backer and Smits."

Drawing on the literatures of influencer content value, influencer credibility, parental mediation, and parasocial relationship (PSR), this study proposed a conceptual model that expounds the appeal of influencers among adolescents. To test the model, we administered an online survey – recruited in proportion to demographic quotas (i.e., age, gender and ethnicity) – among 500 United States adolescents (aged 10- to 19-years old) via Qualtrics panel. Results revealed that, the entertainment value of influencer-generated content, influencer expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness, and followers’ perceived similarity to their favorite influencers, are positively related to the perceived PSR between adolescent followers and their favorite influencers, which in turn, are associated with adolescents’ materialistic views and purchase intentions. We also explored the role of parental mediation of adolescents’ social media use in their PSR with influencers. Results indicate that, neither active mediation nor restrictive mediation is related to the PSR between adolescents and influencers. Active mediation is negatively associated with adolescents’ materialism, whereas restrictive mediation is positively related to adolescents’ purchase intentions toward influencer-promoted products. This study proposed and tested a comprehensive conceptual model that accounts for the role of influencers in adolescent followers’ materialism and purchase intentions. This study yields three major theoretical contributions. First, it adopts and applies the concept of PSR from the literature of media psychology to explicate influencers’ appeal among adolescents, which lays a theoretical foundation for future research on the impact of influencers. Second, it advances the current literature on social media influencers by specifying key contributing factors for the development of adolescents’ PSR with influencers. Lastly, it explores the roles of the two facets of parental mediation – active and restrictive mediation – in the appeal of influencers among adolescents, which offers directions for future research of parental mediation in the influencer context. © Copyright © 2019 Lou and Kim."

Nutrition information conveyed by popular entities through online social networking sites (i.e., social media influencers) has the potential to impact consumer eating behavior through mechanisms of social influence. Little is known about how online communities of food-related social media influencers are structured, which could reveal influencers’ opportunities to observe and spread nutrition-related content and information design practices. This study explored patterns of social relationships (social capital, conservation of resources, and homophily) within a network of prominent food bloggers on Twitter (N = 44). Methods. Data on Twitter following/follower relationships and Twitter use (number of tweets, favorited tweets) were collected from bloggers’ Twitter profiles. Bloggers represented eight topical subcategories of food blogs (e.g., family cooking, cocktails) and comprised a one-mode social network with directed ties indicating Twitter following/follower relationships. Structural evidence of patterns of social ________________ relationships was investigated through social network visualization, centrality measures (in-degree/out-degree centrality, density, reciprocity), and inferential tests. Results. The overall network density of directed ties was 21%, with wide variability in individual blogger centrality across multiple measures. Cocktails, cooking, special diets, and culinary travel bloggers had more dense ties to bloggers in their own subcategories. Within the network, favorited tweets and outreach (Twitter following relationships) were positively associated with popularity (Twitter follower relationships). Conclusions. Food bloggers in this study formed a partially connected network, supporting the conservation of resources framework. Homophily was evident in some, but not all, topical subcategories. Associations among Twitter use, outreach, and popularity generally supported the social capital framework. Future studies should explore influencers’ motivations for connecting on social networking sites, and how content and information design practices spread among influencers. © 2019, Carnegie Mellon University.

In particular, the microblogging service Twitter has been used as a learning tool in the field of medicine as well as a tool for disease surveillance and outbreak management. As antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest concerns of public health, we aimed to review how Twitter is being used as a tool for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). Methods: We used the software Kampal Social® to collect, analyze and monitor tweets from the whole Twitter network to assess the activity that takes place about antibiotics. The study was carried out in three phases: data acquisition, during which we collected data over a six-month period (from 21 September 2016 to 8 February 2017) by monitoring selected users, hashtags and keywords that we knew to be related to AMS; data cleansing, which involved identifying users who were not related to the topic, thus creating a new collection process to remove those users and add newly discovered ones; and, finally, data acquisition and analysis (From 1 April 2017 to 7 March 2018), during which we collected data using the new users obtained in the cleansing phase. We qualitatively characterized the most influential users, we analysed the use of hashtags and the flow of information (the most retweeted users and the global network formed by all the users). Results: Using the tool Kampal Social®, and after a cleansing phase to remove irrelevant information, we worked with a dataset of 1,765,388 tweets. Studying the qualitative characterization of the top-ten influencers, we found that most of them are institutional users, but individual users, such as physicians, and an important medical journal also appeared. Regarding hashtags, ‘#antibiotics’ was the one with the most occurrences. Hashtags follow a regular distribution over time, with some defined peaks connected to important dates and reports about antibiotics. As for the flow of information, we obtained a rather dense network of interconnections formed by all the users who had sent a message, which means that a strong relation exists between the different organizations, professionals and users in general. Conclusions: Institutions, medical journals, physicians and pharmacists are key opinion leaders in the topic of antibiotics, so they must incorporate social media into their communication strategy to spread the AMS message. More evidence is needed regarding the optimal method of communication to spread information throughout the general population. The development of tools capable of collecting and querying large amounts of Twitter data helped us to assess the impact of antibiotic awareness campaigns and to gain an idea of how Twitter is being used to spread the message about AMS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Where is the place you want to visit for your next-coming holiday? Why do you like the music you frequently listen to? If you are like most people, you probably made these decisions as a result of watching influencers on social media. Furthermore, influencer marketing is an opportunity for brands to take advantage of social media using a well-defined and well-designed social media marketing strategy. However, choosing the right influencers is not an easy task. With more people gaining an increasing number of followers in social media, finding the right influencer for an E-commerce company becomes paramount. In fact, most marketers cite it as a top challenge for their brands. To address the aforementioned issues, we proposed a data-driven micro-influencer ranking scheme to solve the essential question of finding out the right micro-influencer. Specifically, we represented brands and influencers by fusing their historical posts' visual and textual information. A novel K-buckets sampling strategy with a modified listwise learning to rank model were proposed to learn a brand-micro-influncer scoring function. In addition, we developed a new Instagram brand micro-influencer dataset, consisting of 360 brands and 3,748 micro-influencers, which can benefit future researchers in this area. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."

It posits that individual consumer-centric factors are influential for B2B marketing as well in sectors such as the travel industry and investigates the determinants of tourists’ intention to use social media websites for travel planning. Design/methodology/approach: Integrating constructs from IS and marketing literature, the paper proposes information quality and perceived enjoyment as antecedents of perceived usefulness, attitude and intention to use. The research model is tested using data from social media users with experience in travel planning. Findings: Results show that perceived usefulness and information quality are stronger predictors of attitude and behavioral intention than perceived enjoyment. Enjoyment was not found to be strongly influential. Relevancy and reliability of information and its usefulness concerning travel-planning needs were found more influential. Research limitations/implications: Data were collected from social media users, raising possible issues of representativeness. Practical implications: The paper offers clarity regarding antecedents of downstream user behavior which can be of significant value. Demarcations in B2B and B2C perspectives blur in the context of social media, enabling more effective integration. Originality/value: The paper brings in and validates the roles of information quality and enjoyment as influencers of behavior. Identifying the travel industry as a sector having greater likelihood of B2BC convergence, the paper extends IS adoption research to user-interactive sites in the travel-planning context, which can benefit the consumer as well as the supply side. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Influencers were seen as opinion leaders, as those whom others would seek out to them in need for help or advice in particular topics. With the emergence of online social media as main environment for information sharing, data that captures reach and engagement can now be accessed and used towards identifying information flow and influence models. The proposed research work aims at contributing to the field by analyzing the dynamics behind influence and the behavioral traits of online influencers in terms of attributed credit of influence. This is done by computing credit scores of attributed influence, studying the time evolution of these scores and the time series patterns of top K nodes of information diffusion.

While “influencers” who have built lucrative followings through microcelebrity give the appearance of having fun without much exertion, recent studies have uncovered multiple forms of labor involved in their practices of cultural production. In addition, scholars analyzing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) influencers highlight a tension between labor in service of self-commodification and the representation of sexual minorities. This article examines the microcelebrity labor of everyday queer women who aim to increase their social and economic capital by interweaving personal self-representations with entrepreneurial endeavors on Instagram and Vine. Through a close analysis of these platforms’ markets, governance, and infrastructures alongside interviews with queer female users of each platform, attention is given to both platform influences and participants’ experiences of promoting their jobs, side-gigs, hobbies, or passions alongside the rest of their lives. Findings identify three modes of labor specific to participants’ efforts to build a following: (1) intimate affective labor expended in sharing and managing personal disclosures; (2) developmental aesthetic labor as the acquisition and practice of technical skills and bodily displays to achieve a desired appearance or performance; (3) aspiring relational labor in attempts to forge relationships with established influencers or celebrities. Sexual identity was pivotal across these modes of labor, as it enhanced intimacy with followers, provided a niche audience for self-branding, conveyed authenticity through self-revelation, and established a common ground for forging relationships. © The Author(s) 2019."

An exploratory study was conducted on the content of the comments, their relationship with other social media actions, subjectivity, and polarity, as well as from the perspective of the participatory culture. The results show that commenting is a potential option for interaction that is underused by the communities of users. Replies to comments are found to be limited to the user-user level, while YouTubers themselves and the moderators that YouTube allows them to designate rarely comment or reply on social networks. However, creators do monitor comments and provide feedback to a limited selection thereof in subsequent videos.

Guided by the influence framework, we propose and test empirically SMIs’ influence mechanism, which occurs in four principal stages: (a) a SMI's influence attempts (showcasing H1: attractive; H2: prestigious; H3 and H4: expert; H5: informative; and H6: interactive Instagram contents); (b) target consumers’ attitudinal response to the influence exercised (evaluating the SMI as a H7: taste and H8: opinion leader); which, in turn, affects (c) the targets’ desire to comply (the desire to mimic); and ultimately (d) their favorable behavioral outcomes (H9: social media word-of-mouth and H10: purchase intentions). On the basis of the survey data from 395 respondents, we used structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses and proposed model. We verified the robustness of our results using an ordered probit regression model and analyzed the mediating role of consumers’ desire to mimic SMIs in the influence mechanism. Our results confirm that the five aspects of influencing posts affect consumers’ attitudes positively and significantly, which in turn leads to positive behavioral outcomes through their desire to mimic SMIs. We discuss the results’ important implications for both scholars and practitioners. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The purpose of this study is to use online social media to understand beliefs and practices surrounding weight gain, diet and exercise during pregnancy among young women. Methods Facebook posts were mined from young women ages 16 to 24 during pregnancy who were consented from two Midwest primary care clinics serving low-income communities. Natural language processing was used to identify posts related to weight gain, exercise and diet by keyword searching. Two investigators iteratively coded the mined posts and identified major themes around health behaviors. Outcome measures included the frequency of posts and major themes regarding health behaviors during pregnancy. Results Participants (n = 43) had a mean age of 21 (SD 2.3), and the largest subgroups identified as black (49%; 26% white, 16% Hispanic, 9% other) and having graduated from high school (49%; 24% completed some high school and 24% completed at least some post-secondary education). Among the 2899 pregnancy posts analyzed, 311 were related to weight. Major themes included eating behaviors and cravings (58% of identified posts), body image (24%), the influence of family, partners and friends (14%), and the desire to exercise (4%).

Objectives: To examine whether exposure to a YouTube video featuring influencer marketing of an unhealthy snack affects children's ad libitum snack intake and whether inclusion of an advertising disclosure moderates this effect. Methods: In a randomized between-subjects design, 151 children (aged 9-11 y; mean, 10.32 y ± 0.6) were exposed to influencer marketing of a non-food product (n = 51), or an unhealthy snack with (n = 50) or without (n = 50) an advertising disclosure. Participants' ad libitum intake of the marketed snack and an alternative brand of the same snack was measured. Results: Children exposed to food marketing with (P &lt;.001, d = 1.40) and without (P &lt;.001, d = 1.07) a disclosure consumed more (kcals) of the marketed snack relative to the alternative; the control did not differ (.186, d = 0.45).

Literature indicates social media platforms had also been used by the firms for building relationship with different stakeholders (i.e. customers, employees, investors and neighbouring communities). But there exists a gap in literature, whether social capital present on social media can be used for building corporate reputation (CR) in the society. Literature indicates corporate social responsibility (CSR) impacts CR. Therefore this study explores how CSR messages on social media impacts CR. For this study assumption was made that all the concerns and issues raised by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the social responsibilities of the CEOs. The study tries to explore this gap by analysing the tweets posted by two group of CEOs, i.e. CEOs in top 200 fortune companies and top 100 social influencer CEOs. Top 100 social influencer CEOs on social media were identified from the Hootsuite.com. Social influencer CEOs are having tremendous amount of influence on Twitter. The statistically test performed on the two group of the CEOs depicts there is significant difference in the number of CSR messages posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs. Results reveals social influencer CEOs had posted 5.97 times more CSR messages on Twitter as compared to fortune CEOs, which in turn may had led to better CR, in terms of shares and likes by social capital present on Twitter. The study reveals may be social influencer CEOs through CSR messages are trying to engage stakeholders strategically on Twitter. This is an open question at present, therefore future researchers can explore this in more details.

This paper aims to synthesize two motivational theories: uses and gratifications (U&G) theory and the technology acceptance model (TAM). Design/methodology/approach: A selective literature review was conducted to examine recent publications related to young consumers’ brand-driven engagement behavior on SMSs in which either TAM or U&G theory was applied. A three-stage method was used: an initial search was followed by vertical and horizontal searches and then a targeted search of scholarly publications. At each stage, the university’s library databases and Google Scholar were searched for relevant, mainly peer-reviewed articles, using appropriate filters and keywords. The articles’ references and the studies that cited those articles were added to the initially identified research pool (vertical search), coupled with publications of a similar nature based on keywords (horizontal search). The final stage, the targeted search, involved identifying and adding specific articles (e.g. literature reviews and integrated models). Findings: After a review of a significant number of U&G and TAM studies, similarities and differences of the two theories were identified, and an integrated operational framework was developed. Based on empirical findings of existing U&G and TAM studies, testable propositions were presented. Research limitations/implications: The proposed hybrid model and the associated propositions provide a research opportunity to empirically examine how young consumers’ motivational (i.e. motivating and demotivating) drivers, normative influence, perceived value and attitudes (toward brand content and engagement) predict intention or actual brand-related behavior on SMSs. Practical implications: Much of current research indicates that generations Y and Z (“digital natives”) spend considerably more time on SMSs than any of the older generations (“digital immigrants”). Thus, brands that aim to target this cohort need to develop successful engagement strategies (e.g. gamification and influencer marketing) on current and emerging SMSs. The suggested conceptualization provides guidelines for companies to effectively use such communication strategies to motivate young people to engage with their brands on sites such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Originality/value: A review of TAM research indicates that it lacks rich motivating/demotivating constructs, and thus borrows from other theories to complement this weakness. An examination of U&G frameworks, particularity Ducoffe (1996)-based models, indicates that these frameworks mainly test engagement with social media advertising but seldom other types of brand-driven engagement on SMSs. In addition, many U&G studies focus less than TAM studies do on outcome variables such as behavioral intentions and behavior. Thus, the authors propose a synthesized U&G and TAM framework that mitigates both theories’ weaknesses and builds on their strengths, enriching the growing research on brand-driven engagement behavior via SMSs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

YouTube is hugely popular with children, and cues featured in content uploaded by YouTube video bloggers (influencers) has been shown to affect children’s eating behavior. However, little is known about the prevalence of such cues, the contexts in which they appear, and the frequency with which they are featured as part of explicit marketing campaigns. The objective of this study was to explore the extent and nature of food and beverage cues featured in YouTube videos of influencers popular with children. All videos uploaded by two influencers (one female, one male) over a year (2017) were analyzed. Based on previous content analyses of broadcast marketing, cues were categorized by product type and classified as “healthy” or “less healthy” according to the UK Nutrient Profiling Model. Cues were also coded for branding status, and other factors related to their display (e.g., description). In total, the sample comprised 380 YouTube videos (119.5 h) and, of these, only 27 videos (7.4%) did not feature any food or beverage cues. Cakes (9.4%) and fast foods (8.9%) were the most frequently featured product types, less frequent were healthier products such as fruits (6.5%) and vegetables (5.8%). Overall, cues were more frequently classified as less healthy (49.4%) than healthy (34.5%) and were presented in different contexts according to nutritional profile. Less healthy foods (compared with healthy foods) were more often; branded, presented in the context of eating out, described positively, not consumed, and featured as part of an explicit marketing campaign. These data provide the first empirical assessment of the extent and nature of food and beverage cue presentation in YouTube videos by influencers popular with children. Given the emerging evidence of the effects of influencer marketing of food and beverages on children’s eating behavior, this exploratory study offers a novel methodological platform for digital food marketing assessment and delivers important contextual information that could inform policy deliberations in this area. © Copyright © 2019 Coates, Hardman, Halford, Christiansen and Boyland."

The message’s design variables have been classified into four main groups: (i) Message Tools (presence of text, images, video, labels, applications, interactive games and events calendar or others), (ii) Appropriate Message Structure (length and intelligibility), (iii) Informative Cues (links to the brand, orientation towards the product or the brand, topics relevant to the audience, and a remuneration’s promise) and (iv) Persuasive and Emotional Cues (emotional signals, valence, endorsement and influencer mentions). The focus has been a tourist destination: Brand Spain that is advertised through Facebook. A content analysis was carried out and regression analysis with optimal scaling was used on 180 Spain brand’s publications; 57,626 audience reactions to such publications; and 1361 audience comments on the Brand Spain Official Fan Page. According to our results, from the four blocks of predictive variables, only two of them are useful to predict Positive/Negative Engagement: (i) the use of Message Tools (videos), and (ii) the use of informative cues (relevant topics, links on posts, and post’s orientation towards product). © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

It shows how online advertising is fundamentally different from traditional advertising in print media, offline media sites (such as billboards) and broadcasting. The growth of social media usage has created an opportunity for online advertising to exploit ways of advertising which are only beginning to be understood fully and receive regulatory attention, and which, therefore, may exploit current regulatory loopholes. In this article, we identify two major issues in respect of online advertising of online gambling: first the potential for unethical placing of gambling advertising targeted at vulnerable users, and secondly the opaque use of commercial advertising in user-generated content on social media platforms. Having identified these two problems of gambling advertising, we take stock of how the existing regulatory structures deal with gambling advertising online, with a view to making recommendations on how to tackle these problems. We argue that data protection law and gambling regulation have not yet satisfactorily addressed these issues and that a much more radical approach is needed, as set out in the article. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The findings suggest that sponsored blogging affects online engagement (e.g., posting comments, liking a brand) differently depending on blogger characteristics and blog post content, which are further moderated by social media platform type and campaign advertising intent. When a sponsored post occurs on a blog, high blogger expertise is more effective when the advertising intent is to raise awareness versus increase trial. However, source expertise fails to drive engagement when the sponsored post occurs on Facebook. When a sponsored post occurs on Facebook, posts high in hedonic content are more effective when the advertising intent is to increase trial versus raise awareness. The effectiveness of campaign incentives depends on the platform type, such that they can increase (decrease) engagement on blogs (Facebook). The empirical evidence for these findings comes from real in-market customer response data and is supplemented with data from an experiment. Taken together, the findings highlight the critical interplay of platform type, campaign intent, source, campaign incentives, and content factors in driving engagement. © American Marketing Association 2019."

Many of these posts are sponsored by a brand, while others are in the form of genuine advice. Influencers might choose to add a disclosure (“this is not sponsored content”)in non-sponsored product posts that highlight their impartiality. This information ought to affect how consumers respond to the post. In two experiments, we examine how emphasizing impartiality in influencer product posts affect consumers' response by applying a 3 (disclosure type: impartial vs. explicit sponsorship vs. no disclosure)factorial-design. In the second experiment, we further examine how disclosure type and landing page type (e-commerce product page vs. start page)from brand hyperlinks in the influencer post, interact to form consumer brand attitudes and purchase intentions. The findings reveal that impartiality product posts are less likely to be perceived as advertising compared to sponsored product posts or posts without sponsorship information, and therefore generate higher source and message credibility. Additionally, participants’ brand attitude and purchase intention are reduced when they are directed to a product page instead of a start page when being simultaneously exposed to an impartiality disclosure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Congruence between the photo and the celebrity has the strongest positive effect on photo attitudes and purchase intentions.

This study explores how positive and negative priming of sponsored content shapes the authenticity perception of the vlogger among its audience members. Four different manipulation conditions were constructed to study a U.S. based travel vlog on Qualtrics, with data collected via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. A theory-guided content analysis of 211 open viewer responses was conducted to compare perceptions of authenticity between the manipulation groups. The results verified the significance of priming: the same sponsored content can result in opposite reactions among the audience members depending on the positive/negative valence of the introductory text attached, highlighting the central importance of strategic communication related to the perception of sponsored content. The results also point out the importance of audience member engagement for experienced authenticity: The manipulation of audience participation with the vlog had a stronger effect on the perception of authenticity of the vlogger than the positive/negative valence of the introductory text. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, despite the growing relevance of this new strategic communication instrument, research has paid only limited attention to elaborating its basic concepts. In this article, we adopt a strategic communication perspective to develop a conceptual framework for strategic social media influencer communication. Particularly, we draw on research findings that identify the external resources social media influencers contribute to organization-influencer cooperation. We use these findings to systematically develop functional definitions of social media influencers and of strategic social media influencer communication. We define social media influencers as third-party actors who have established a significant number of relevant relationships with a specific quality to and influence on organizational stakeholders through content production, content distribution, interaction, and personal appearance on the social web. Subsequently, we define strategic social media communication as the purposeful use of communication by organizations or social media influencers in which social media influencers are addressed or perform activities with strategic significance to organizational goals. We then situate these definitions within the broader framework of strategic communication by discussing related concepts and by describing the strategic action field that has emerged around strategic social media influencer communication. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Sustainable health promotion programmes require a thorough understanding of the social context in which minors engage. Initial studies show that young people make extensive use of social networks in order to exchange experiences and gather information. During this process their (buying) behaviour is significantly affected by so-called influencers. Methods: The exploratory research studies non-campaign driven health communication on dieting and exercise by influencers in social networks with a focus on content, techniques and visible impact. In a mixed methods approach, we initially analysed 1000 posts from influencers on Instagram quantitatively. Subsequently we conducted an in-depth content analysis of 9 extreme and 27 typical communication threads. Results: Influencers gain the trust and friendship of their followers by designing body-shape focused visual content and targeted communication techniques. They identify and define diet and exercise as factors to be controlled for body perfection. By consuming dietary supplements and wearing tight-fitting branded sportswear, influencers promise a simplified way of optimizing one's appearance as the key to happiness. Direct and surreptitious advertising of industry-specific products constitutes the communicative focus. At the same time, minors identify with the roles and ideals demonstrated by influencers and their needs are satisfied on several different levels. This creates a relationship of dependency between influencers and their followers. Conclusions: The dynamics in the field of health communication by influencers on social networks will become increasingly important in the coming years. This is largely due to the targeted demand on the part of (mainly) underage users and the high attractiveness of influencer marketing on the part of companies. Influencers suggest a dependence on happiness, well-being, health and beauty. Only those who create a body shaped through control and discipline are healthy and beautiful - and can be happy. The indirectly communicated conclusions, which can be considered as extremely critical, illustrate the need for action in order to protect and positively accompany young people in their psychological and physical development. The shift of authority figures within Generation Z, as well as identified communication techniques, can be considered and may be harnessed by targeted, group-oriented campaign designs. © 2019 The Author(s)."

MMPs have also been investigated in the context of their ECM remodeling activity in several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, after several MMP inhibitors failed in phase III clinical trials, a global reassessment of their biological functions was undertaken, which has revealed multiple unanticipated functions including the processing of chemokines, cytokines, and cell surface receptors. Despite what their name suggests, the matrix aspect of MMPs could contribute to a lesser part of their physiological functions in inflammatory diseases, as originally anticipated.

This study focuses on the emergence of influential individual users on Twitter and explores the reason why they achieved a significant number of followers during one of the most devastating disasters: Hurricane Harvey. The diverse patterns of increases in followers for the emerging influencers may be separated into several types. Among those types, Twitter users who posted objective disaster-related information in clear language and a consistent fashion tended to show an increase in followers and emerged as influential users. Additionally, professionals (from the media industry, public agencies and departments, and research organizations) made significant contributions to public information and warning during the hurricane.

Similarly, we exploit the practice of social TV and investigate the support for the referendum expressed by the 160,465 tweets posted by second screeners, that is, the subsample of Twitter users who watched and actively commented on nine political talk shows during the campaign. We compare the mentions and the attitudes of the Twittersphere and the second screeners by means of a lead–lag analysis to test whether the second screeners can act as influencers and trendsetters able to shape or anticipate attention and opinions toward an issue within larger audiences.

Drawing on motivational factors related to social distance and applying Cognitive Transactional Theory as a theoretical lens, our empirical analysis is based on 657 broadcasters on the market-leading social live streaming platforms in China. This study reached the following findings: Users’ social distance from SMIs is positively related to their broadcast intention. Challenge stressors and hindrance stressors have different mediating effects between social distance and broadcast intention. Challenge stressors positively mediate the relationship between social distance and broadcast intention, and hindrance stressors negatively mediate the relationship between these two variables. Users’ material values moderate the relationship between hindrance stressors and broadcast intention.

The proposed theoretical model consists of the celebrity type as the independent variable, social presence as the mediator and self-discrepancy as the moderator. Design/methodology/approach: A randomized two-group comparison (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) between-subjects experiment (n=104) was conducted. Findings: The results indicate that consumers exposed to Instagram celebrity’s brand posts perceive the source to be more trustworthy, show more positive attitude toward the endorsed brand, feel stronger social presence and feel more envious of the source than those consumers exposed to traditional celebrity’s brand posts. Structural equation modeling (Mplus 8.0) and bootstrap confidence intervals indicate that social presence mediates the causal effects of celebrity type on trustworthiness, brand attitude and envy. Multiple regression analyses reveal the moderating effects of appearance-related actual–ideal self-discrepancy. Practical implications: Ultimately, managerial implications for social media marketing and Instagram influencer-based branding are provided. From the perspective of marketing planning, the findings speak to the power of influencer marketing as an effective branding strategy.

Companies that embrace influencer marketing have limited control over content and context, so they must evaluate both the SMIs and the content they post, prior to and during their collaborations. Although quantitative success metrics (e.g., number of followers, number of likes) are readily available, it remains unclear whether such metrics offer appropriate proxies for evaluating an SMIs or the outcomes of an influencer marketing campaign. By combining secondary data on influencer marketing campaigns from Instagram with an online survey among marketers, this study finds that professionals generally rely on an SMI’s reach and number of interactions as success metrics. When they must trade off across multiple metrics, these professionals predominantly rely on comment sentiment, indicating their implicit awareness that the commonly used metrics are inadequate. A regression analysis affirms that only the sentiment measure correlates positively with professional content evaluations, so this study both challenges the use of common quantitative metrics to evaluate SMI content and emphasizes the relevance of content-based metrics. © The Author(s) 2019."

One of the most significant problem in the context of a social network is finding the most influential entities within the network. This task has significance in viral marketing, since the most influential entities can be targeted for endorsing new products in the market. However, the problem of discovering the most persuasive node in a social network has proved to be NP-hard and also the exact algorithms cannot be designed. This creates a wide scope for developing approximation methods and algorithms that are able to produce solutions with proven approximation guarantees. Greedy algorithm serves as a base for most of the existing algorithms designed for dealing with these problems. Greedy algorithm can achieve a good approximation, but it is found to be computationally expensive. Therefore, in this paper we propose a two level approach, designed based on Suspected-Infected (SI) epidemic model for maximizing the influence spread. We further propose that, multithreading approach for implementation of algorithm for the proposed SI model aids to further elevate the performance of proposed algorithm in terms of influence spread per second. © 2017 The Authors"

We argue that social media are creating a new class of self-directed online traders by simultaneously encouraging and biasing trading decisions. Through an empirical study, we show that heavy social media users are more likely to engage in online trading but are largely affected by online herding behavior, and are four times more likely to blindly follow other traders. Bloggers, influencers, social network contacts, and social media news shape these users’ online trading behaviors. As online traders influenced by social media are unlikely to receive adequate returns, companies face an ethical dilemma: They could leverage social media to efficiently access funds but they risk inappropriately exploiting the inexperience of online traders biased by social media. We offer a set of nine practical recommendations for organizations to respond to these new challenges. © 2019 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University"

The results suggest that Twitter is a highly valuable source of disaster-related information particularly during the power outage. With a substantial increase in the number of tweets and unique users during the Hurricane Sandy, a large number of posts contained firsthand information about the hurricane showing the intensity of the event in real-time. More specifically, a number of images of damage and flooding were shared on Twitter through which researchers and emergency managers can retrieve valuable information to help identify storm damages and plan relief efforts. The social media analysis revealed the most important information that can be derived from twitter during disasters so that authorities can successfully utilize such data. The findings provide insights into the choice of keywords and sentiments and identifying the influential actors at different stages of disasters. A number of key influencers and their followers from different domains including political, news, weather, and relief organizations participated in Twitter-based discussions related to Hurricane Sandy. The connectivity of the influencers and their followers on Twitter plays a vital role in information sharing and dissemination throughout the hurricane. These connections can provide an effective vehicle for emergency managers towards establishing better bi-directional communication during disasters. However, while government agencies were among the prominent Twitter users during the Hurricane Sandy, they primarily relied on one-way communication rather than engaging with their audiences, a challenge that need to be addressed in future research. © 2019"

The first is to examine the amount of time children spend per week on viewing vlogs. Second, the authors explored children’s awareness and understanding of the brand or product placement in vlogs. Finally, the authors explored children’s self-perceived susceptibility to the potential persuasive effects of these vlogs. Design/methodology/approach: Self-reported measurements were assessed among children (N = 127, 10-13 years of age). Findings: Results indicate that the majority of children frequently view vlogs and that their degree of bonding with the vlogger predicted the time spend on viewing vlogs. Children recalled products and brands that were shown in vlogs, which were mostly food and beverages and considered themselves and others affected by endorsements in vlogs. Research limitations/implications: Only cross-sectional data were collected; these data cannot be used to analyze behavior over a period of time or draw causal inferences. Practical implications: Considering the popularity of vlogs among young people, it is important to acquire more insight into the frequency and amount of time children spend on viewing vlogs and children’s processing of persuasive messages in vlogs. This may lead to a better understanding of underlying processes and prediction of the outcomes of advertising through this form of media content. Current findings raise further questions about the persuasive content of vlogs. Originality/value: Because of the popularity of online (social media) channels among youth, companies dedicate a significant proportion of their marketing budget on online influencer marketing.

A sponsorship compensation justification disclosure explains why influencers and brands engage in sponsorship collaborations by providing a normative reason that justifies the existence and dissemination of sponsored content. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental design was used to compare the effects of a sponsorship compensation justification disclosure made by either an influencer or the sponsoring brand, to a simple sponsorship disclosure and a no disclosure control post, on consumers’ responses to a product-review video by a YouTube influencer. Findings: The paper offers empirical evidence that sponsorship compensation justification generates more positive consumer attitudes toward influencers receiving sponsorship compensation, and increases source and message credibility, compared to a simple sponsorship disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The hypotheses were tested on one YouTube video, comprising of a single product category, one SMI and one social media platform. Further studies might replicate the experiment on different product categories and on different social media platforms.

Vape tricks are promoted on social media, but the promotion of vape tricks on social media is not well understood. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine how vape tricks were promoted on YouTube to youth. Methods: Videos on vape tricks that could be accessed by underage youth were identified. The videos were coded for number of views, likes, dislikes, and content (ie, description of vape tricks, e-cigarette devices used for this purpose, video sponsors [private or industry], brand marketing, and contextual characteristics [eg, model characteristics, music, and profanity]). Results: An analysis of 59 sample videos on vape tricks identified 25 distinct vape tricks. These videos had more likes than dislikes (11 to 1 ratio) and a 32,017 median view count. 48% (28/59) of the videos were posted by industry accounts (27% [16/59] provaping organizations, 15% [9/59] online shops, and 3% [2/59] vape shops) and 53% by private accounts (55% [17/31] private users, 26% [8/31] vape enthusiasts, and 19% [6/31] YouTube influencers); 53% (31/59) of the videos promoted a brand of e-cigarette devices, e-liquids, or online/vape shops, and 99% of the devices used for vape tricks were advanced generation devices.

At the same time, public relations (PR) and marketing practitioners are grappling with how to interact and ‘work’ with these, among other, social media influencers who are increasingly seen as able to sell products and ideas through their blogs, Instagram, Facebook and other social media platforms. The relatively new relationships between PR practitioners and social media influencers raise questions of unequal power and vulnerability for both the largely amateur influencers and the PR practitioners. The relationship between the two means that ethical questions around exploitation, authenticity, professionalism and control have arisen, with both sides feeling their way in new terrain. This article uses the concepts of precarity and liminality and applies them to a group of ‘mommy/mummy/mum bloggers’, that is, blogging mothers of young children, negotiating their identities as mothers, and moving beyond their homes using social media to, in part, create a sense of belonging (but also, in some cases, to make money). The article is based on the author’s own longitudinal digital ethnography within online influencer territory, and includes mainstream and online media reports and interviews with both mum bloggers and PR practitioners. It is argued that the marketisation of motherhood within a dominant culture of neoliberalism means that practitioners may wrongly assume that mum bloggers are acting freely to engage with entrepreneurial endeavours. © The Author(s) 2019."

Through the relational dynamics of the communication on these networks, many users have emerged whose opinions can exert a great deal of influence on public conversation online. This research aims to identify the influential Twitter users during the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships using different variables which, in turn, represent different dimensions of influence (popularity, activity and authority). Mathematical variables of the social network analysis and variables provided by Twitter and Google are compared. First, we calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient among all users (n = 20,175) in pairwise comparisons. Next, we performed a qualitative analysis of the top 25 influential users ranked by each variable. As a result, no single variable assessed is sufficient to identify the different kinds of influential Twitter users. The reason that some variables vary so greatly is that the components of influence are very different. Influence is a contextualised phenomenon. Having a certain type of account is not enough to make a user an influencer if they do not engage (actively or passively) in the conversation. Choosing the influencers will depend on the objectives pursued. © 2019 by the authors."

In this study, the quantification and classification of SMIs is addressed by proposing an advanced methodology based on social network analysis - K-shell decomposition - together with a discussion on the relationship between the different SMI categories and the effect of each type of influencer on the public relation activity of an organization. The developed methodology was tested through an action research project conducted at the Teatro alla Scala of Milan, and the results were then discussed with the management of the opera house. The main finding of this work is that SMIs can be split into writers, authorities or spreaders on the basis of the kind of influence they exert, thereby delivering a precisely focused typology of SMIs.

At the same time, the cosmetics retail industry is expected to rapidly grow further in the next few years, on account of the already mounting demand and easy availability of cosmetics through online channels. The purpose of this study is to explore the use of beauty Instagram influencers in advertising as a tool to increase competitiveness for SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory research design was used and in-depth interviews were conducted to get a better understanding of female Saudi young adults’ perceptions with regards to trust towards Instagram influencers, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and advertising. Findings: SMEs can benefit greatly from eWOM in their quest for competitiveness. Therefore, when a beauty influencer on Instagram advertises a product to SMEs followers this leads to increased awareness and purchase intention. The findings indicated that the participants are quite sceptical when receiving reviews or promotion from beauty influencers on social media, as they rarely regard them as authentic. Moreover participants seem to trust influential beauty Instagrammers when they had a positive experience with the influencer before.

People became more eager to express and share their opinions on web regarding daily activities as well as local or global issues. Due to the proliferation of social media for instance Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and others, sentiment analysis and opinion mining grow rapidly. It branches out from the field of natural language processing and data mining particularly from web mining and text mining. Why sentiment analysis and also known as opinion mining is prevalent and relevant nowadays? When we try to decide to purchase a product, we are likely to get the opinions from friends or relatives and do some surveys before we purchase the product. Hence, opinions are undeniably the key influencer of our behavior as well as the central to nearly all of the activities. Within the opinions, we often find the neutral, positive and negative polarities in the sentences. Based on the sentiment analysis taxonomy, it has opinion mining to have the opinion polarity classification, subjectivity detection, opinion spam detection, opinion summarization and argument expression detection. On the other hand, emotion mining has the emotion polarity classification, emotion detection, emotion cause detection and emotion classification. If it is based on granularity level, it has sentence level, document level and aspect/entity level of sentiment analysis. As for the machine learning approaches, it has semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning and supervised learning of sentiment analysis. © 2019 IEEE."

METHODS: In a between-subjects design, 176 children (9-11 years, mean 10.5 6 0.7 years) were randomly assigned to view mock Instagram profiles of 2 popular YouTube video bloggers (influencers). Profiles featured images of the influencers with unhealthy snacks (participants: n = 58), healthy snacks (n = 59), or nonfood products (n = 59). Subsequently, participants' ad libitum intake of unhealthy snacks, healthy snacks, and overall intake (combined intake of healthy and unhealthy snacks) were measured. RESULTS: Children who viewed influencers with unhealthy snacks had significantly increased overall intake (448.3 kilocalories [kcals]; P = .001), and significantly increased intake of unhealthy snacks specifically (388.8 kcals; P = .001), compared with children who viewed influencers with nonfood products (357.1 and 292.2 kcals, respectively). Viewing influencers with healthy snacks did not significantly affect intake. CONCLUSIONS: Popular social media influencer promotion of food affects children's food intake. Influencer marketing of unhealthy foods increased children's immediate food intake, whereas the equivalent marketing of healthy foods had no effect. Increasing the promotion of healthy foods on social media may not be an effective strategy to encourage healthy dietary behaviors in children. More research is needed to understand the impact of digital food marketing and inform appropriate policy action. Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics"

This article explores conscious, instrumental interactions with algorithms, as a window into the complexities and extent of algorithmic power. Through a thematic analysis of online discussions among Instagram influencers, I observed that influencers’ pursuit of influence resembles a game constructed around “rules” encoded in algorithms. Within the “visibility game,” influencers’ interpretations of Instagram’s algorithmic architecture—and the “game” more broadly—act as a lens through which to view and mechanize the rules of the game. Illustrating this point, this article describes two prominent interpretations, which combine information influencers glean about Instagram’s algorithms with preexisting discourses within influencer communities on authenticity and entrepreneurship. This article shows how directing inquiries toward the visibility game makes present the interdependency between users, algorithms, and platform owners and demonstrates how algorithms structure, but do not unilaterally determine user behavior. © The Author(s) 2018."

Nowadays, a single post by a fashion influencer attracts a wealth of attention and a magnitude of followers who are curious to know more about the brands and style of each clothing item sitting inside the image. To this end, the development of efficient Deep CNN models that can accurately detect styles and brands have become a research challenge. In addition, current techniques need to cope with inherent fashion-related data issues. Namely, clothing details inside a single image only cover a small proportion of the large and hierarchical space of possible brands and clothing item attributes. In order to cope with these challenges, one can argue that neural classifiers should become adapted to large-scale and hierarchical fashion datasets. As a remedy, we propose two novel techniques to incorporate the valuable social media textual content to support the visual classification in a dynamic way. The first method is adaptive neural pruning (DynamicPruning) in which the clothing item category detected from posts' text analysis can be used to activate the possible range of connections of clothing attributes' classifier. The second method (DynamicLayers) is a dynamic framework in which multiple-attributes classification layers exist and a suitable attributes' classifier layer is activated dynamically based upon the mined text from the image. Extensive experiments on a dataset gathered from Instagram and a baseline fashion dataset (DeepFashion) have demonstrated that our approaches can improve the accuracy by about 20% when compared to base architectures. It is worth highlighting that with Dynamiclayers we have gained 35% accuracy for the task of multi-class multilabeled classification compared to the other model. © 2018 IEEE."

The look of the fashionable ideal is, of course, ever subject to change. However, there are qualities that are always present: the body is subject to the authority of fashion, limitations to the autonomy of the body such as gravity or ageing are absent, and the figure is imbued with possibility and mutability, even as it freezes a momentary state of perfection. These qualities become particularly marked in the present era, in which digital influencers simultaneously assume the roles of cultural producer, model and consumer while implicitly embodying the fashionable ideal. At the moment of their publication, the labor of producing these images seems to evaporate, as bodies with no material limitation are presented with immediacy, and figure, commodity and surrounds collapse into one. This article interrogates how we can conceive of the labor of appearance and being in the fashion image, and considers how this style of fashion imagery draws on visual rhetoric of prior eras of fashion photography and is structured by the existing power relations of capitalism and the human and non-human actors of media technologies. In so doing, the concept of the fashionable ideal is explored in one of its contemporary iterations as fluid, aspirational, global, simultaneously embodied and disembodied. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This was an extreme manifestation of a corrosive problem: Traeger's culture had become poisonous, characterized by lack of trust, negative attitudes, and a stubborn refusal to collaborate. Very early in his tenure, employees would ignore Andrus when he asked for data, or simply refuse to work together on a project. Once, when he was visiting headquarters, the CFO said he couldn't find any time in his schedule to meet with the new CEO. Although the majority owner had no operating role, he talked daily to people at all levels of the company and was aggressive and abusive. People were afraid of him, but they acted as if he were in charge. After the truck fire, Andrus resolved to start from scratch. He bought out the majority owner, moved the headquarters from Oregon to Utah, carefully winnowed the employees, worked to create a physical environment that feels true to the brand, and built a community of fans and influencers on social media.

Drawing on literatures about consumer culture, celebrity, and digital labor; interviews with 25 participants in Instagram's influencer economy; and industry texts, we elucidate the power dynamics and contradictions manifested in constructing a shoppable life. We emphasize how social media users navigate the imperative to produce an ""authentic"" but branded and monetizable self, the personal risk they bear in doing so, and the stakeholders who mediate and profit from these productions. We also highlight conceptual points of entry for critical attention to the logic of shoppability, which increasingly pervades spaces and cultures. © 2019 The Author(s)."

The article argues that there are three types of value creation evident in visuals created by the influencers: as attempts at celebritization, in telling the story of the brand, and as role of models of aspirational consumer-citizenship. It is argued that the visual work undertaken online by social media influencers contributes in significant ways to the production of the value of global brands, and that this should be contextualized within the unique socio-economic aspirations of consumers based in the global south. © The Author(s) 2019."

To exemplify this process, we draw attention to the transition from pseudonymous to identifiable authorship in feminist blogging. This transition toward professional digital presence is important for two major reasons: first, it reveals how oppositional politics is part of the commercial circuits and neoliberal market logics of identity management; second, it underscores the ways in which online harassment of feminist bloggers can harm their public identities and negatively impact their larger professional self-making. Further, we suggest that feminist bloggers perform a dual role of social media influencers and web-based public intellectuals as they affectively participate in the political sphere through systematic production of oppositional knowledge and counter-discourses.

This exploratory study consists of two parts: (1) a synthesis of vlog commentary college and career advisement videos, coding for the quality of advisement, usability, and user experience, and (2) an advisor effectiveness and user experience survey using a selected minority social media influencer who provides computing college and career advisement. Findings suggest YouTube influencers are effective (over a series of measures), particularly for beginners in the computing field. As minorities heavily participate in and enjoy the use of YouTube and social media, computing advisement influencers on social media allow for supplemental advisement at a wide scale.

As ‘prosumers’ (i.e. consumers turned producers), successful mum bloggers are often courted by international brands and organisations. While mum bloggers were early adopters in the digital landscape, everyday (non-blogging) mums have also embraced technology and have become avid users of social media, in particular Facebook, and are sometimes influenced by the bloggers they follow. Invariably, as pro-am mothers, mumpreneur bloggers use their families (in particular, their young children) as characters in their story posts and also co-opt them in sponsorship and other money-making opportunities. These posts help the audience identify with the bloggers, increasing their social capital and influence. Everyday mothers may also follow the example set by the mumpreneurs, sharing images and stories related to their offspring, sometimes from the first ultrasound scan.

Sites, including Twitter, provide a unique space for the public to access and discuss health information. The objective of this study was to better understand how social media users are sharing information about genetics and genomics in health and healthcare and what information is most commonly discussed among Twitter users. Methods: We obtained tweets with specific genetics- and genomics-related keywords from Crimson Hexagon. We used Boolean logic to collect tweets containing chosen keywords within the timeframe of October 1, 2016, to October 1, 2017. Features of the software were used to identify salient themes in conversation, conduct an emergent content analysis, and gather key demographic information. Results: We obtained 347,196 tweets from our search. There was a monthly average volume of 28,432 tweets. The five categories of tweets included: genetic disorders/disease (45.3%), health (15.6%), genomics (8%), and genetic testing (7.3%). Top influencers in the conversation included news outlets and universities. Conclusions: This content analysis provides insight about the types of conversation related to genomics and health. Conversations about genomics are occurring on Twitter, and they frequently emphasize rare genetic diseases and genetic disorders. These discussions tend to be driven by key influencers who primarily include news media outlets. Further understanding of the discussions related to genomics and health in social media may offer insight about topics of importance to the public. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Many people use social networks to communicate and express their opinions in supporting or opposing different causes, with most of this user-generated content being textual information. As there are a lot of raw data of people posting real time messages about their opinions on a variety of topics in daily life, it is a worthwhile research endeavor to collect and analyze these data, which may be useful for government to make informed decisions or to monitor public opinion. Data available in social media is obviously only one type of information that can be of interest when trying to detect a possible terrorist or radical group, there are several cases for example in which the social media has been used by radical thinkers to act as influencers and encourage fanatics with the same radical views to take violent action.

This chapter will primarily address the extent, nature and effects of broadcast and digital food marketing to young children, including an exploration of traditional and contemporary psychological theories that may explain some of the observed behavioral effects. The literature on broadcast food marketing is robust and shows that advertising of products which are high in fat, salt and sugar increases children’s consumption, preferences and requests for these products. However there are fewer studies on digital food marketing. This research is important, as digital is now children’s primary and preferred form of media. Types of digital food marketing which will be covered are food brand websites, advergames, targeted advertisements and social media marketing. On social media, marketers use direct and indirect avenues for promoting their products. Direct forms of marketing include strategic placement of adverts both in and around social media, and food brand social media pages. Indirect forms include electronic word-of-mouth marketing via peers, social influencers and celebrities.

However, at the same time companies have increased marketing of unhealthy products, including sugary drinks, fast food, candy, and snacks, to adolescents and young adults. Although older youth tend to be highly skeptical of marketing, they are also highly vulnerable to marketing influence, albeit in different ways. For example, their still-developing brains are highly responsive to reward cues and emotional messages; and their developmental need to establish separate identities leads them to value peer opinions and act to portray a socially desirable image. Many common food marketing techniques take advantage of these vulnerabilities, including social media marketing, celebrity endorsements, sports and music sponsorships, and influencer marketing. In addition, marketing disguised as entertainment content (e.g., video games, movies, TV shows, music) is designed to hide the persuasive intent of these messages and circumvent skeptical responses. In this chapter, we will discuss common food marketing techniques used to target adolescents and young adults and the psychological processes that make young people highly vulnerable to their influence. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Frans Folkvord; individual chapters, the contributors."

Nowadays, many users generate contents on brands they like, or do not like, and share those opinions with other consumers from all over the world (Smith et al. 2012). In this environment, the opinion of some content providers has gained a lot of credit among their peers. Called “social media influencer (SMI),” their influence is such that before deciding to buy a product, some of their followers would systematically consult the SMI’s opinion (Moon and Han 2011). Brands did not fail to notice this particular influence and a vast majority of them seized the opportunity to develop partnerships with influencers to see their products praised by the SMI. The practice is called product placement (PP) (Russell 2002). Yet, the context of SMI presents several differences with that of traditional PP which suggest an original persuasion process that deserves scholar and managerial attention. First, the strength of the relationship between SMIs and their audience, relying on parasocial interaction (Lueck 2015), is quite unique in the marketing and advertising context, where audiences do not usually share a personal relationship with the source of the commercial message (Colliander and Erlandsson 2015). Second, SMIs endorse products at a pace that has never been considered before. They are “serial recommenders,” implying high frequencies of attempts of influence. Recommendations—of potentially different brands in the same product category—may impact subsequent ones in a looping mode. Third, the audience’s involvement in the communication and the PP is also unique: although targets of PP in movies do not watch movies for the PP, SMIs’ followers seek SMIs’ opinion on products and brands. Finally, most audiences do not clearly identify the commercial dimension behind a PP offered on social media (Boerman et al. 2017), which increases the effectiveness of the practice (Charry and Tessitore 2016) and calls for additional investigations on consumers literacy and empowerment. The objective of this work is to investigate the persuasion process at play in the very specific context of SMIs’ PP and to provide a better understanding of consumers’ responses and empowerment. In order to do so, we will focus on the relationship between SMI and their followers; followers’ attributions of SMI’s motivations; the impact of the repetitive dimension of the practice, also at different levels of satisfaction, especially on engagement; and factors of consumers’ empowerment.

Influencers have traditionally created their own user-generated content (UGC) like blogs or vlogs. Moreover, marketers identify UGC as effective for brand promotion because consumers perceive it as more credible than marketer-generated content (MGC) and have paid celebrities and social media influencers to create UGC. The lack of research aimed at investigating how influencers (vs. celebrities) persuade consumers with UGC versus MGC motivates this research. Using source effects theory and processing fluency to inform the research, one 2 (content: UGC vs. MGC) × 2 (endorser: celebrity vs. social media influencer) between subjects design was conducted using a snowball sample on social media targeting European women (n = 138; Mage = 25) participants on social media. The results revealed a significant two-way interaction on attitudes toward the brand and purchase intentions. Post hoc analysis indicated that UGC leads to higher attitudes toward the brand and intentions to purchase the product featured when using social media influencers. Additionally, when using MGC, a celebrity endorser generates higher attitudes toward the brand and intentions to purchase the product. These findings provide several theoretical and practical implications. First, the results suggest that the effectiveness of marketing communication resides in the interaction of the endorser and the content type, consistent with processing fluency. Second, the results indicate that UGC is most effective when the endorser is an influencer versus a celebrity. Likewise, an influencer is most persuasive with UGC rather than appearing in content the brand has created to feature the endorser. Third, the research illustrates that certain source characteristics (e.g., power vs. trust) may explain why UGC (vs. MGC) is more successful when using influencers (vs. celebrities).

In September 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched an anti-vaping campaign, in U.S. high schools, on social media and other platforms, emphasizing ""The Real Cost""of e-cigarettes. Using a novel deep learning approach, we assessed changes in vaping-related content on Instagram from 2017 to 2019 and drew an inference about the initial impact of the FDA's Real Cost campaign on Instagram. We collected 245,894 Instagram posts that used vaping-related hashtags (e.g., #vape, #ejuice) in four samples from 2017 to 2019. We compared the ""like""count from these posts before and after the FDA campaign. We used deep learning image classification to analyze 49,655 Instagram image posts, separating images of men, women, and vaping devices. We also conducted text analysis and topic modeling to detect the common words and themes in the posted captions. Since September 2018, the FDA-sponsored hashtag #TheRealCost has been used about 50 times per month on Instagram, whereas vaping-related hashtags we tracked were used up to 10,000 times more often. Comparing the pre-intervention (2017, 2018) and post-intervention (2019) samples of vaping-related Instagram posts, we found a three-fold increase in the median ""like""count (10 vs. 28) and a 6-fold increase in the proportion of posts with more than 100 likes (2 vs. 15%). Over 70% of Instagram vaping images featured e-juices and devices, with a growing number of images depicting a ""pod,""the type of discrete vaping device that delivers high concentration of nicotine and is favored by novice e-cigarette users.

Nowadays, besides being used to interaction, social media accounts can also be utilized to gain income or material benefits.

The social media actors on YouTube are referred to as YouTubers or content creators. This research is a normative juridical legal research with the descriptive method of analysis. The result of the study shows that YouTube accounts as digital assets in practice can be used as assets in business activities. This is proven by the existence of a YouTuber or content creator who sells his account for charity or commercial purposes. In the future, YouTube accounts can potentially be a digital asset that can be used as a collateral object due to its economic value.

This illusion of freedom was quickly dismantled when it became clear that companies such as Facebook and Google were, in fact, changing and also normalizing social relations. So what are the social media and how do they work from the point of view of governmentality and control? Is it as simple as to say that social networks and Web 2.0 manipulate their users? And, if so, how do they do it? In this paper, I will look at the practices associated with social media using some of Foucault's ideas and concepts, like disciplinary power, governmentality, biopolitics and so on, and also Deleuze's idea of a “society of control,” created by the dissipation of power in the rhizome we now know as Web 2.0. How does power work in a decentralized environment? Is it the companies that offer the platforms for social interactions that hold the power? I argue that power has become a network, a rhizome, not merely a relationship, and each and every one of its users/nodes contributes to the development of a biopower that regulates and normalizes life. The pop-cultural argument that is prevalent these days is that the life we see on social media is not “real,” but that is not the case, it is as real as it can be because people strive towards that normalized life. There are two examples I use to explain my point: the so-called “influencer” culture (the culmination of social media marketing of the self) and the Google Selfish Ledger (an idea leaked from Google that says the company can use the data it gathers about its users to change their behavior in accordance with “Google's values”). © 2019 Ovidius University.

This is especially true for fashion bloggers and ‘Influencers’, who live – or try to live – off their blogs and/or Instagram accounts. Creating a specific visual universe on these platforms appears to be a common and crucial practice among these content producers. Based on a long-term anthropological fieldwork project among female fashion and lifestyle bloggers in Copenhagen, I look at bloggers online and offline in an attempt to make anthropological sense of what the ‘posting of images’ on Instagram is culturally and microsocially about. In this paper, I argue that this generation of bloggers constructs what I have termed a photomimetic self. They do this to create a recognizable digital online self, crafting it to attract an audience, which, in turn – if large and rich enough – may attract lucrative collaborations with companies that want their brands marketed. Thus, the popularity of this visual and digital identity is key for bloggers who wish to live off their postings. My central argument is that the photomimetic self, although portraying a ‘now’, projects a mimicked future; it is an ideal, phantasmic, a coat stand of dreams and wishes created to attract audiences in order to bring this future self into the life of the offline present self. © 2019 Altrimedia Edizioni.

However, SNSs also play a significant role in the spread of spread fake news. Specifically, fake news concerning politics regularly reaches more people quicker than all other types. This phenomenon recently appeared during the 2019 Nigerian Presidential Election, where there have been fake news reports about a dead president with clones acting in his place. Earlier studies have been mostly quantitative and have focused on the characteristics of the individual’s social network. We propose to qualitatively explore this phenomenon with a focus on the characteristics of the individual sharing fake news.

Companies spend an increasing amount of money on working with influencers who promote the products/brands through their social media posts. Instagram, a popular social networking site, has become the most used platform by social media influencers for brand promotion. This has led to emergent research on social media influencers and how they shape their follower’s behaviors. Two key factors have been found to impact the behaviors of influencers’ followers: opinion leadership of and para-social relationship with the influencer.

To gain competitive advantage in this billion-dollar industry, marketers have now begun to use Digital Marketing (DM) predominantly to connect and build long term relationships with customers, spread product/service awareness, acquire feedback and provide customer support in this technological era. Marketers however, find a gap in developing effective DM strategies specifically targeting MT patients in the relentless healthcare market influenced by various external forces. The main aim of the study is to identify the role of DM in MT and more specifically how it can be leveraged to attract international patients to Dubai. The research employs Game theory (GT) and Network theory (NT) in relation to use of an agent/facilitator and social media (SM) respectively. In addition, the study also evaluates the importance of DM strategies followed by different internationally accredited hospitals to create awareness and recommends a systematic DM customer journey map useful for creating systematic DM strategy for MT marketing to achieve better results. 12 marketing professionals working for Hospitals/Clinics in Dubai were interviewed. Findings reveal a positive impact of DM to boost MT, it’s helpful in creating strong brand image and impacts consumer decision making of choice of destination by MT patients. We also found that responsive websites, effective email marketing, Social media marketing (SMM), video marketing, content and influencer marketing are most effective strategies. Moreover, the research identifies 6 emergent themes which will provide hospitals with a better understanding of how to re-evaluate the impact of their existing DM strategies in consumer decision making about MT destinations. Finally, the study offers practical recommendations for healthcare marketers to enhance admission of medical tourism patients. © The Authors, 2019. All Rights Reserved."

This research shows that common loyalty programs have negative connotations, because hotel guests are inundated with them and the immediate benefits are not noticeable from the customers' point of view. A sustainable loyalty program ideally offers playful incentives so that guests do not lose interest in it. Research found that many guests like to be part of an exclusive online community, where loyalty programs should be based on. Building a community, it is important that all stakeholders can derive added value and do not feel exploited. Moreover, empirical results show that hotel guests expect personalized incentives and offers. To provide these, tourism companies should cooperate with third-party partners. Communities on digital platforms like Instagram or Facebook can generate new guests by word of mouth, short eWOM. Experiences show that recommendations are made when expectations are exceeded: To increase this effect, incentives are still seen to be meaningful, but the nature and (digital) communication channels are changing. Social incentives, such as exclusive events, services or personal guest care, are clearly preferred instead of monetary incentives. It is also human interaction that binds guests to a hotel, which cannot be compensated by monetary incentives only. When guests are individually and immediately rewarded and when their expectations are met, word-of-mouth on social media lead to new customers. Moreover, research indicates that guests often act as micro-influencers on social media and ratings platforms. If they are convinced and find ""instagrammable moments"", they intrinsically report about a hotel and their services on social media. To recommend a hotel to friends, most guests do not expect anything in return, because they want to be credible and authentic. © 2019."

Scholars have underscored the effectiveness of Twitter in galvanising the opinion of broad sectors of the public and expressing the indignation of average citizens on issues of social concern (Bruns et al., 2015; Martínez, 2017). The rise of feminist social media activism has prompted a number of studies on the feminist movement’s use of hashtags to foster online conversations on specific issues (Jinsook, 2017; Turley & Fisher, 2018; etc.). This article examines the correlation between the degree of ideological commitment amongst social media users and the nature of their Twitter conversations on a given issue. The analysis focuses on Twitter conversations generated by feminists, influencers, journalists and politicians in reaction to the controversial sentencing of the Wolf Pack (La Manada) –a gang of men involved in a sexual assault perpetrated during the San Fermín festival in Pamplona. Big data techniques were used to explore the nature of messages containing four highly charged hashtags central to feminist discourse on this issue: #YoSiTeCreo (Yes, I believe you), #HermanaYoSíTeCreo (Yes, sister, I believe you), #Cuéntalo (Talk about it) and #NoEstásSola (You are not alone). Our findings indicate that the levels of ideological commitment of Twitter users participating in what was essentially a feminist conversation varied to an extent that impeded serious interaction amongst them, either online or offline. From the perspective of communication strategy, feminist hashtag activism would appear to be an intermediate step in a longer process of creating a higher consciousness regarding gender equality issues in Spain. © 2019 Communication & Society."

We investigated from a trust transfer perspective how the endorsement of a social media influencer (SMI) can improve consumers’ app adoption intention, within the framework of the technology acceptance model. Using structural equation modeling, we demonstrated that consumers’ trust in an SMI had a direct influence on their trust in an app. Moreover, the endorsement of an SMI increased consumers’ trust in the app through the perceived usefulness (but not the ease of use) of the app. Our results also showed that structural assurance, download volume, and online ratings were positively correlated with consumers’ trust in the app. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are discussed. © 2019 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited.

We found that the pontiff's populism is confined to simple and appealing rhetoric, emotionalization, and some other aspects of populism, but his rhetoric is also different because his communication style goes without enmity and division remains on an abstract level.

The research is applied to the protests from two perspectives: the first refers to the way in which, especially well-known, artists become influencers of protest movements, by joining the protesters in the streets, by intensively using social media or by creating artistic products that support the protests; the second perspective refers to the identification of various forms of action that entail a significant artistic component, employed by protesters in order to accomplish the desired results: mobilisation of participants, generating solidarity or gaining the media‘s attention. In this research we have combined quantitative and qualitative analysis of data in order to explore the presence of the artistic dimension during the protests from the beginning of 2017. The active involvement of notorious Romanian artists from different fields was unprecedented in Romania, as they had an important contribution in promoting the dominant way of thinking and, consequently, in creating a sense of solidarity and mobilising people. Activism was visible online and offline, as protesters showed their creativity in slogans, banners with humorous, ironic or uncompromising images and messages, in spectacular choreographies and laser projections but also in releasing manifesto-songs. © 2019, Biblioteca Astra Sibiu.

Despite this, peer-to-peer and educational influence on social media has not been studied within orthopaedic surgery. This knowledge is important to identify who is controlling the conversation about orthopaedics to the public. We hypothesized that the plurality of top influencers would be sports medicine surgeons, that social media influence would not be disconnected from academic productivity, and that some of the top social media influencers in orthopaedic surgery would not be orthopaedic surgeons. AIM To identify the top 100 social media influencers within orthopaedics, characterize who they are, and relate their social media influence to academic influence. METHODS Twitter influence scores for the topic ""orthopaedics"" were collected in July 2018 using Right Relevance software. The accounts with the top influence scores were linked to individual names, and the account owners were characterized with respect to specialty, subspecialty, practice setting, location, board certification, and academic Hirsch index (h-index). RESULTS Seventy-eight percent of top influencers were orthopaedic surgeons. The most common locations included California (13%), Florida (8%), New York (7%), United Kingdom (7%), Colorado (6%), and Minnesota (6%). The mean academic h-index of the top influencers (n = 79) was 13.67 ± 4.12 (mean ± 95%CI) and median 7 (range 1-89) (median reported h-index of academic orthopaedic faculty is 5 and orthopaedic chairpersons is 13). Of the 78 orthopaedic surgeons, the most common subspecialties were sports medicine (54%), hand and upper extremity (18%), and spine (8%). Most influencers worked in private practice (53%), followed by academics (17%), privademics (14%), and hospital-based (9%). All eligible orthopaedic surgeons with publicly-verifiable board certification statuses were board-certified (n = 74). CONCLUSION The top orthopaedic social media influencers on Twitter were predominantly board-certified, sports-medicine subspecialists working in private practice in the United States. Social media influence was highly concordant with academic productivity as measured by the academic h-index. Though the majority of influencers are orthopaedic surgeons, 22% of top influencers on Twitter are not, which is important to identify given the potential for these individuals to influence patients' perceptions and expectations. This study also provides the top influencer network for other orthopaedic surgeons to engage with on social media to improve their own social media influence. © The Author(s) 2019.

We identified five basic forms through which users create and present their identities: The Public diary, The Influencer, The Entertainer, Job and education and Hobby, as well as the appropriate secondary roles performed by users who interact with them. These findings are corroborated by 8 semi-structured interviews with respondents, which enable a more in-depth exploration of the way they use Facebook, the social interactions they participate in, their motivation for posting contributions, and how they engage in impression management, perceive privacy and resolve issues caused by multiple audiences. A better understanding of how privacy is conceived and what motivates users to share their personal information online is essential for public authorities’ cooperation on shaping company privacy policies and creation of appropriate legal regulations.

In view of gathered data communicating a frequent occurrence of advertising products and practices for multiple purposes, manifesting at the macro level, the research proposes and adopts a novel 5th dimension of the domestication concept and four new instances of boundary-work. These represent substantial conceptual developments which together with presented empirical data exploring various links and interdependencies serve as a solid base to a future research that could investigate such relationships on larger - quantitative scale. Various combinations of the 5th dimension and novel instances of boundary-work were found in 69% of participants. This represents a significant involvement originating directly out of the macro level where variety of social media influencers operate, fuelling participants' functional (fused) uses particularly by sharing of knowledge and promotion of related products and practices. © 2019 Academic Conferences Limited.

In the present paper, the authors emphasise a need for change in consumer behaviour as a result of the implemented marketing communication from the part of businesses in the online environment. They mainly focused on the application of innovative forms of promotion of ecological products through social media in order to enhance awareness of eco-innovations in both the general and expert public. Simultaneously, they draw attention to a growing demand for eco-friendly products, which enables businesses to reevaluate the effectivity of formerly applied marketing strategies. Globalisation efforts of nowadays have made bio-degradable plastic products a real necessity. First social networking websites are considered a unique tool by means of which the topic of environmental protection could be presented to the young. Ensuring a certain level of environmental awareness in a practical life may be accomplished by endorsement from so-called influencers. By publishing high-quality and educative content, these can popularise various corporate social responsibility projects which could possibly have a positive impact on future generations in the field of environmental activism, community activities and motivation in problem-solving linked to creation of healthy environment. Thanks to the power of social media we are able to „consume“not only visually attractive content, but also share freely our own interesting and reliable information with our friends and relatives. In the paper, the authors present partial outcomes of the primary marketing research to have been implemented on the specific sample of respondents representing businesses operating within Slovakia and thus define particular tools of social networking websites and their role in promotion of eco-innovations. Unless producers of goods and providers of services pay enough attention to environmental protection, we cannot expect any change in thinking of their employees or business partners and eventually of all prospective customers. Existence of various forms of social networking websites provides an opportunity how to responsibly form a public opinion in the long term and increase interest in environmental and ecological education. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

The problem is that there are still a few SME actors who can make optimal use of the internet and social media as a marketing communication strategy. most of the SME actors use influencer strategies from public figures at a high cost. This strategy is considered to be less effective, and burdensome to SME actors, who have problems with capital. Some of the SME actors have succeeded in developing marketing communication strategies by optimizing the internet and social media through creative content from their marketing messages. The purpose of this study is to explore how SME actors can build consumer trust through creative marketing communication content. This study uses a qualitative approach with a case study method on SME actors who use creative content in their marketing communication strategies on the internet and social media. This study produced two main points, firstly the marketing communication strategy in the SMIs had communication competencies from the SME actors themselves. Second, organic message content by raising the character of the business owner can help shape the character of the product, and the character of the product can be product differentiation, which can ultimately shape the product brand. the stronger the organic message content produced, the stronger the brand that is formed to form trust in the minds of consumers. © 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice."

We examine a new breed of travel and tourism worker— intermediaries who seek to professionalize and formalize the relationship between influencers and destination marketers while simultaneously solidifying their own role within the industry. Intermediaries promote and facilitate relationships based on structured flexibility—formalized agreements designed to satisfy a brand’s campaign goals yet open enough for influencers to pursue their unique needs.

The research purpose is to study if characteristics of an influencer‘s Instagram account affect the influencer‘s opinion leadership as well as its consequences on the behavioral intention of Indonesian cosmetic product consumers. The study uses a quantitative survey conducted on 250 Instagram users who follow selected celebgrams or celebrities who endorse cosmetic products. A hypothesized model is built to analyze the antecedents and consequences of the opinion leadership of the two types of influencer. As for opinion leadership antecedents, both models show that originality of the Instagram account is crucial in building up the opinion leadership, while quality and quantity of the Instagram posts are not significant factors. Perceived uniqueness of the account seems to affect the opinion leadership only for celebrity accounts and not for the celebgrams‘. Further, findings suggest that opinion leadership affect consumer behavioral intentions, namely intentions to interact, recommend, and follow advice. Finally, the account's perceived fit with personal interest is not affecting the relationship between opinion leadership and the intention to follow advice for both celebrity and celebgram. The findings suggest some important implications for cosmetic companies in utilizing opinion leaders as their promoters, and also for micro-influencers that are beauty gurus who wish to learn the important key factors to attract more Instagram followers and build their social media communities. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Searching for diversity-related issues, researchers asked whether diverse groups were represented among the most influential accounts. It also identified the most common topics shared, and whether the shared content represented democratic discussion. Finally, the study looked at how much election-relatedsharing among influencers conformed to a media logic or social media logic framework. Researchers found that Twitter use during the election campaign did not provide a level playing field for political discussion. Instead, data suggested individual celebrity users were more likely to be amplified than others. Despite this, however, it appears that issues that were relevant to diverse groups made it into the Twitter conversation, making up a meaningful portion of tweets related to the election. These findings suggest that if diverse voices were not retweeted, at least issues were still being discussed, and thus contradict  the popular idea of online echo chambers on Twitter. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis."

Native ads typically blend with their surrounding context, stem from sources or placements that do not signal advertising, lack overtly persuasive or sales-focused messaging, and have less clear material outcomes. Such characteristics raise ethical concerns because native ads are more difficult for consumers to identify and because they challenge concepts that are central to current deceptive advertising policy. Native advertising is a Federal Trade Commission enforcement priority, and the agency has developed guidelines for this new ad form. However, the unique characteristics of native advertising likely require novel approaches to protect consumers. In this article, the authors trace the evolution of regulation relevant to native advertising. They identify shortcomings and propose remedies that the Federal Trade Commission or industry could adopt to prevent consumer harm, detect infractions, and enforce its regulations.

Paradoxically, some netizens are actively divulging their privacy online. Noticeably, some information is specifically guilt-related, though confession online is considered irrational. This preliminary study strives to understand this guilty information disclosure behavior through a mixed-approach. Analyzing posts and comments in a confession forum on Reddit, we find that sex-related and recreation-related topics prevail. Our qualitative investigation produces a thematic model with 71 codes, 17 concepts, 4 frames, 3 categories, and 9 relationships, capturing the intents, content, influencers of this behavior, and the interactions among users. Our contribution relies on the investigation of this peculiar behavior to better understand people’s privacy behavior. Also, we render a sophisticated framework around guilt-inducing behaviors useful for future work.

Psychological action is where the propagandist attempts to change opinions using only psychological means where the individual or organization doubts the validity of their belief system and actions. Psychological warfare is the psychological action when it is applied to an adversary. Propaganda plays on personal complexes, drives, motivations, passions, and prejudices. The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence identified examples of this type of propaganda and manipulation with the Russian Federation conducting influence operations (IO) worldwide with the manipulation of social media, Democratic National Committee (DNC) decisions, election polls, and even TV station broadcasts. Offensively, these examples of soft cyber power directly support the Military Deception (MILDEC) used to deliberately mislead the adversary or potential adversary and thereby allowing the execution of operations. These forms of manipulation are also used by non-military adversaries such as Internet trolls, Gamergaters, Hate Groups & Ideologues, Conspiracy Theorists, Influencers, Hyper-Partisan News Outlets, and Politicians. In an attempt to counter these attacks, this research will use a grounded theory approach to examine how John Boyd’s observe–orient–decide–act (OODA) loop theory can be leveraged in a workflow of digital analytics that could possibly be used to be used to enhance the prosecution of disinformation and fake news. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

Social media influencers exhibit their personal life through posts to many followers and influence their follower's attitudes and engagement behaviour. However, many firms seek to collaborate with social media influencers and reach their potential customers through brand sponsored posts. Therefore, the better the understanding of customer engagement behaviour within brand sponsored posts is fundamental for firms in achieving brand awareness, new customers or/and driving sales. Customer engagement with social media posts involves active customer responses (e.g., Like) and passive participation (e.g., view). Yet, little is known about how customers engage with influencer informational content posts that are sponsored by a luxury fashion brand. There is also scant attention to the gender of social media influencers, to posts accompanied with a luxury brand product and its influence on customer attention patterns. These customer attention patterns are gauged by neuro-marketing techniques that are not accessible through traditional marketing methods. Therefore, this research seeks to examine customer responses to social media influencer posts, focusing on posts with a luxury brand product, emotional cues of text (i.e., emoji), and influencer gender. The research also investigates how the gender of an influencer affects how a follower reacts to a post, especially when promoting a brand product. To examine customer responses, a combination of self-report and eye-tracking methodology was used, where social media posts by a male influencer generated greater customer attention on a luxury product. However, social media post by a female influencer generated more customer likes while the post by males generated more customer views. Thus, customers ignored emotional cues of posts (e.g., heart-eye emoji) which are presented at the end of sentences. Importantly, the paper provides a pioneering attempt in examining the relationship between features of social media influencer posts and customer responses. © The Authors, 2019. All Rights Reserved."

It suggests social actors draw upon Instagram’s affordances at material, conceptual, and imaginary levels while using social media. This triadic model for theorizing affordances of Instagram responds to the need for mapping ontologies and typologies of social media within increasingly visual, intercultural, and non-Western contexts. The lenses of critical multimodality and a participant-centered method consider how female Gulf-Arab social media influencers operate through an interplay of shifting affordances in ways that challenge current conceptions of authenticity surrounding social media influencers. It is suggested that the triadic affordances of Instagram, occurring at material, conceptual, and imaginary levels, provide both influencers and followers with strategies of “fantastical authenticity” for navigating conflicting modes of representation and self-presentation within local and globalized economies. © The Author(s) 2019."

Based on a series of semistructured interviews with Filipino influencers, we asked how influencers understand, engage, and commodify the audience for their content. We suggest that social media influence work in the Philippines is defined by globally connected but locally rooted practices of performed authenticity through which creators employ conscious and identifiable strategies to cultivate a local audience that mostly occupies very different socioeconomic, linguistic, and cultural positions from the creators themselves. We argue that understanding authenticity as work that can be performed and negotiated between producers and their audiences offers new and interesting directions in approaching the commodification of social media audiences. © 2019 Jeremy Shtern, Steph Hill, and Daphne Chan."

Others, for instance online activists, are not less important but their characterisation still requires experimenting. We make the hypothesis that such interesting users can be found within temporally and spatially localised contexts, i.e., small but topical fragments of the network containing interactions about social events or campaigns with a significant footprint on Twitter. To explore this hypothesis, we have designed a continuous user profile discovery pipeline that produces an ever-growing dataset of user profiles by harvesting and analysing contexts from the Twitter stream. The profiles dataset includes key network and content-based users metrics, enabling experimentation with user-defined score functions that characterise specific classes of online users. The paper describes the design and implementation of the pipeline and its empirical evaluation on a case study consisting of healthcare-related campaigns in the UK, showing how it supports the operational definitions of online activism, by comparing three experimental ranking functions.

In 2018 the Council of Europe adopted a Recommendation on strengthened cooperation against vaccine preventable diseases. Among EU Member States, Italy has a long-lasting tradition of immunization policies implemented in the context of the National Health Service over the last forty years. Methods. We identify, report and critically appraise four immunization strategies implemented in Italy in recent years and quantitatively assess their impact on coverage rates and other selected indicators. Results. First: the regional law that suspended mandatory vaccination in the Veneto Region in 2007 to stimulate a proactive approach to vaccine uptake was not successful. Second: a strengthened political commitment started in 2014 brought to the release of an innovative and updated National Immunization Prevention Plan and to encouraging increase in vaccine confidence and vaccination uptake. Third: the success of social media influencers is exemplified by the case of Roberto Burioni, professor of microbiology, who in 2015 started a personal social media campaign to contrast anti-vaccinists. Fourth: The new 2017 Italian law extending mandatory vaccinations has successfully impacted on vaccine coverage which increased by more than 1% and 4% for polio and MMR vaccines, respectively, in the first six months since its entering into force, and has continued to raise in 2018. Discussion. Our data and real-life case studies offer to the broader European public health community a solid basis for discussion and ground to evaluate similar polices implemented in different European settings, with the common goal to share best practices and promote the culture of immunization. © 2019 Societa Editrice Universo."

For example, Instagram has become a relevant communication medium for more than 800m people worldwide (Statista 2018b). As consumers are becoming more connected and more mobile, companies have to explore creatively how to use social media in winning their attention and building relationships. Still, many businesses are lagging behind in practices that react appropriately. This chapter seeks to close this gap by discussing an illustrative case study in the context of social commerce (s-commerce) for practitioners. Specifically, we aim to answer various calls for empirical research by investigating one best practice case of influencer marketing through social media. This study analyses electronics supplier Huawei’s storytelling campaign #ShowWhatYouLove, examining s-commerce characteristics in the use of Instagram and complementing the analysis with rich industry data by Social Match, a German influencer marketing agency.

Accordingly, this study aims to examine the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on Instagram on hijab culture among Muslim women in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among female university students from the International Islamic University of Malaysia (N = 630). In order to participate in the study, respondents completed an online survey and are instructed to think about a favourite female Muslim celebrity they follow on Instagram while completing the research instrument. Results indicate that almost one-third of the most popular Muslim celebrities among females Instagram users are non-traditional celebrities (i.e. bloggers/vloggers, YouTube personalities and social media influencers). Furthermore, attitude homophily and parasocial interaction with said celebrity may significantly influence the likelihood that the celebrity’s profile will be visited, and the number of likes on their photos. Finally, after controlling for the respondents’ religious educational background, this study found that those who had positive attitude and behaviour towards the hijab, and perceived a higher degree of parasocial bond with Muslim celebrities on Instagram tended to have a more positive perception towards the hijab culture. The repercussions of these findings on the parasocial interaction theory, and the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on social media over hijab culture are discussed. © 2019, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

This calls for a segmented approach in which interventions are targeted at online communities, tailored to their specific cultures and health-related perceptions, and leverage the dynamics of conversation and social influence in online networks. Strategies drawn from the field of influencer marketing provide interesting opportunities to reach and engage with audiences in a personally relevant manner, including with those who may disagree with an intervention’s message. This article reflects on what health communicators might learn from influencer strategies and proposes digital methods to target and tailor health communication in the digital era. More concretely, we present methods to: (a) identify online communities engaging on a specific health issue; (b) map community specific cultures and health-related perceptions; and (c) identify influencers as potential collaboration partners. As such, we adopt a slightly different take on tailoring by putting the creative and cultural competences of social influencers central, and by aligning our methods with a media mapping protocol to create influencer strategies that are tailored to the cultures and health-related perceptions of multiple online audience segments. We illustrate the potential of these methods with a study of how vaccination is discussed among Dutch Twitter users. © The Author(s) 2019."

Previous studies have used lay health influencers to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among internet-using men who have sex with men (MSM). However, there is a lack of understanding of the characteristics of this key subset of MSM. Objective: This study aimed to examine sociodemographic characteristics, HIV and syphilis testing, and sexual behaviors of Web-based MSM sexual health influencers (SHIs) in China, defined as individuals with relatively stronger influence on spreading HIV and STI information online. Methods: A Web-based survey of MSM was conducted in August 2017 as a final follow-up of a randomized controlled trial promoting HIV testing in 8 Chinese cities. Men were recruited through a gay social networking mobile phone app and were included if they were born biologically male, aged 16 years and above, ever had sex with another man, and HIV negative or with unknown HIV status. Information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and HIV and syphilis testing was obtained. We assessed men's Web-based sexual health influence using a standardized 6-item opinion leadership scale focused on HIV and STI information. Influencers were defined as those whose mean score ranked within the top 13% (a higher score means greater influence). We used multivariable linear and logistic regression models to measure Web-based sexual health influence's association with HIV and syphilis testing, controlling for intervention trial effects, age, education, income, and marital status. Results: Overall, 1031 men completed the survey. Most men were younger than 30 years (819/1031, 79.43%) and had at least college education (667/1031, 64.69%). Influencers were more likely to get tested for HIV (73/132, 55.3% vs 337/899, 37.5%; P<.001) and syphilis (35/132, 26.5% vs 137/899, 15.2%; P=.001) in the last 3 months compared with noninfluencers. There were no significant differences in condomless sex with male partners (26/132, 19.7% vs 203/899, 22.6%; P=.46), mean number of male sex partners (1.32 vs 1.11; P=.16) in the last 3 months, and mainly meeting male sex partners online in the last 12 months (97/132, 73.5% vs 669/899, 74.4%; P=.82) between influencers and noninfluencers. Regression analyses showed that influencers had higher odds of HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 2.16, 95% CI 1.48-3.17) and syphilis testing (AOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.28-3.10) in the last 3 months. Conclusions: We identified Web-based SHIs who might be more likely to help promote healthy HIV and syphilis testing behaviors through MSM populations. Leveraging existing influencers may help improve HIV and syphilis testing among their networks. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved."

Most medical organizations have created policies and initiatives on diversity and inclusion, focusing on supporting underrepresented minorities. Similar discussions are taking place online, including on Twitter, via specific hashtags, such as #BlackMenInMedicine, #ILookLikeASurgeon. News reports suggested some of these hashtags were “trending.” We set out to assess selected hashtags and analyze their spread, as well as whether or how health professional organizations publicized or amplified this emerging discourse on Twitter. Methodology: We computed tweet volume, retweet volume impressions, and spread for selected hashtags and for health-profession organizations. Results: The overall volume was average or below average when compared with all active Twitter users; however, the retweet percentage was 60%, suggesting high levels of engagement. There was modest spread of most of the messages containing the hashtags, with the exception of #ilooklikeasurgeon tweets, due to its relationship to the cover of a major nonmedical magazine. Spread for some hashtags, despite very low initial retweets, was increased due to retweeting by accounts with high volume of followers. Medical societies’ contributions to dissemination were very minor. Conclusion: Strengthening, deepening and, ultimately, expanding the conversation on diversity and inclusion in medicine on Twitter requires an intentional and strategic use of hashtags, photographs and links; Engaging “influencers” such as mainstream media and medical organizations is also critical to more widespread dissemination. © 2018 American Board of Family Medicine.

Prospective patients may seek out surgeons with greater number of followers. Recently, companies selling Twitter bots have been exposed. The authors sought to examine the number of fake users, practice types, and the content of tweets broadcasted by top influencers in plastic surgery. Methods: Top 100 influencers were identified. The influencers were categorized into academic versus private practice and sorted according to their board-certification status. Among each board-certification status, the top five influencers of each category (American Board of Plastic Surgery, American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, international plastic surgeon, other physician, nonphysician) were determined, and their 300 most recent tweets were analyzed for educational, promotional, or personal content. Fake bots among respective followers were identified by TwitterAudit. Results: Private practice surgeons represented 68 percent of the top tweeters. Academicians were only 8 percent. American board-certified surgeons represented 55 percent of the top tweeters. Compared with American board-certified surgeons, nonphysicians had a higher number of fake bots. Among the 7500 tweets that were analyzed, nonphysicians were more likely to have promotional and less likely to have educational posts when comparing to board-certified American or international plastic surgeons. Conclusions: Plastic surgeons are quick to adapt to the dynamic and evolving nature of social media. However, academic surgeons are poorly represented among the top influencers. Although top influencers are board-certified plastic surgeons, they continue to occupy only a fraction of the total discourse on plastic surgery.

With the identification of these users within the network, many applications can be built for user recommendation, information diffusion modeling, viral marketing, user modeling and many more. In this paper, we aim to identify topic-based experts using a large dataset collected from Twitter. Our proposed approach has three phases: (1) identification of topics on social media posts (more specifically, tweets), (2) user modeling, based on a group of user specific features, and (3) Influence Factorization to identify topical influencers. The main advantage of the proposed method is to identify future influencers as well as current ones on Twitter. Moreover, it is an easy to implement algorithm using Spark MLlib, which can be easily extended to include other user specific features, and compare with other methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a large dataset that contains tweets of 180K user over 70 day period. The experimental results show that our proposed method identifies influencers successfully when used with a hybrid user specific feature that contains follower count and authenticity information, and is a highly scalable and extensible algorithm. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

This idea came with the fast development of social media, where individuals are increasingly sharing their personal experiences, opinions and critiques about products through these platforms. Thus, the new customers can rely on these spontaneous recommendations to proceed with the purchase without risk of disappointment. Therefore, the mismanagement of the e-reputation can cause huge losses for companies. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a product reputation framework based on the prediction of opinion leaders is presented. To do so, opinion mining has been used to determine the product reputation in social media. In addition to posts processing, the profile information has also exploited to predict opinion leaders. To achieve the authors’ goal, spammers and duplicated profiles have been detected to improve the product reputation results. Findings: The effectiveness of this approach has been tested using a social media simulation. The obtained results show that this approach is efficient and more accurate compared to the classical solutions. Originality/value: The key novelty is the gathering of spammer detection criteria with different weights and the profiles matching by providing the suitable matching methods that take into account the profile’s attributes types. Consequently, a different similarity measure was assigned for each of the considered four attributes types. These two steps can ensure that the results obtained from social media are actually supported by opinions extracted directly from the real physical consumers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

To fill this gap, this research investigates motives of hashtag use and their effect on behavioral outcomes based on the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach. Through a two-phase mixed method data collection, we distill six motives of hashtag use in the context of Instagram: Self-presentation, Chronicling, Inventiveness, Information Seeking, Venting, and Etiquette. We find drivers for platform use to affect these motives, which, in turn, influence the frequency of clicking and adding hashtags, and the number of hashtags a user may employ in a post. Furthermore, we find potential influencers to be heavy users of hashtags, primarily driven by motives of self-presentation, and to score higher on narcissism, extraversion and self-monitoring than followers. We further assert the need for U&G studies to explicitly acknowledge the nature of social media that allows users to both consume and produce content.

Prior research, through the lens of service-dominant logic, has conceptualised fans as active, commanding and critical influencers, revealing complex, multifaceted and developing co-creative relationships, but invariably only with their teams, clubs and online communities, limiting what is currently known about fans, sponsors and co-creation. Given this gap, the current study seeks to explore the perceptions and antecedents of this relationship across European football leagues with an emphasis on understanding perspectives on user generated advertising, developing social media content, creating brand culture and new product/services development for sponsoring brands. Exploratory in outlook, the paper adopts a social constructionist position, utilising 296 participants, from 9 leagues and incorporating 59 clubs. The study reveals the dynamic nature of the fan/co-creation relationship, with data indicating that fanatical and regular fans view co-creation as a cynical, intrusive and disruptive process, while casual fans seem more willing to engage, albeit episodically and driven by the anomalous emotions of guilt and superstition. The paper uncovers behaviours that offer insight for both brand managers and clubs into the reality of fan engagement in the context of co-creation. This offers a contribution to theory by positing five new behavioural categories related to perception of and engagement with co-creation activity: Defectors, Rejecters, Absorbers, Moralisers and Repenters. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd."

Such hidden advertisements appear on social media platforms when content creators or “influencers” endorse products and brands in their content. While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires content creators to disclose their endorsements in order to prevent deception and harm to users, we do not know whether and how content creators comply with the FTC’s guidelines. In this paper, we studied disclosures within affiliate marketing, an endorsement-based advertising strategy used by social media content creators. We examined whether content creators follow the FTC’s disclosure guidelines, how they word the disclosures, and whether these disclosures help users identify affiliate marketing content as advertisements. To do so, we first measured the prevalence of and identified the types of disclosures in over 500,000 YouTube videos and 2.1 million Pinterest pins. We then conducted a user study with 1,791 participants to test the efficacy of these disclosures.

We employ computer-mediated discourse analysis to analyze the pragmatic meanings conveyed through emoji sequences and their rhetorical relations with accompanying text, focusing on posts by social media influencers and their followers on a popular Chinese social media platform. The findings show that the emoji sequences can function pragmatically like verbal utterances and form relations with textual propositions, although their usage differs from textual utterances in several respects. We also observed user innovations that make the sequences more language like, although there is not as yet a fixed grammar of emoji sequences. We characterize this emoji use as an emergent graphical language, with the caveats that it is not yet a fully-formed language and that the Chinese emoji language that is emerging is different from the English variety, and therefore emoji are not a universal language. In order to promote the further development of emoji language(s), we advance recommendations for emoji design grounded in linguistic principles. © First Monday, 1995-2018."

This integrated framework offers a refined conceptualization and measurement of social media influence in crises by incorporating the network perspective. We tested the framework with large-scale Twitter data from four crises. Results from multigroup CFA on Twitter influencers suggest that social media influence is composed of four factors: output, reactive outtake, proactive outtake, and network positioning.

Influencer marketing is considered more effective than traditional marketing. Influencers are more trustworthy than a business due to the fact that they have developed close connection with their followers. This marketing trend has played an important role in the rise of fake influencers in Twitter. Fake influencers inflate their follower counts by buying fake Twitter accounts from vendors and they manage to partner with companies. However, that partnership does not benefit companies as the influencer's engagement is fake.

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on Bourdieu’s theory of practice and in particular his notion of social capital, this exploratory study is based on the critical analysis of 31 semi-structured interviews with senior PR professionals in Singapore and Perth, Western Australia. Findings: PR professionals concur with assumptions made in the extant literature regarding the potential of digital media for PR, despite broad agreement that the fundamentals of good communication have not changed. At its core PR is about counselling, relationships and the building of social capital. Hence, digital tools and platforms are typically being referred to as merely an extension of the PR toolkit. However, as illustrated within the context of influencer engagement, PR has increasingly adopted advertising-led models and has moved away from its core business of developing strategic relationships and goodwill, hence contributing to the convergence of previously distinct communication functions. Originality/value: This paper is believed to be one of the first to look at the theory of social capital related to PR within a digital context. Further, it takes a holistic view of PR professionals’ views on working with digital media in two geographical locations that have been under-represented in scholarly work in the field of PR. While much of the extant literature has focussed on the benefits of social media for PR, this paper takes a critical look at current challenges, including the rise of social media influencers.

The paper argues that the relationship is symbiotic; both parties have to understand the importance of adapting their engagement with one another, especially if they hope to produce brand work that is impactful for target audiences and highlights the value of good communications and marketing to leadership. Design/methodology/approach: The views expressed in this practice paper are based on the author’s extensive experience in the communications sector in the Middle East. Findings: The paper highlights the importance of human creativity in communication campaigns, the need for bravery in marketing communications, and the need to adapt to technology. The best client/agency relationships combine the right degree of closeness and distance that allows agencies to be passionate advocates for the client while also being honest on stakeholder reactions. But, honesty requires courage. Telling a client what they need to hear and putting aside the fear of upsetting those who pay the bills in the search for the most effective creative idea takes nerve. Finally, the greatest change to the practice of communication is technology. Originality/value: Although the relationship between clients and their communications agencies has been a topic of interest, much of the focus has been on the bottom line. This has been attributed to multiple reasons such as increased digital focus, or a belief among many brands that developing in-house capabilities provides better returns on investment. This practice paper addresses the agency–client relationship from a different perspective arguing for a symbiotic relationship built on creativity, honesty, bravery and the need to adapt to technology. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The amount of information exchanged is vast, while users have become equally producers and consumers of data. Words like ""trending"", ""influencers"", ""likes"" and ""viral"" are in the daily agenda of data analyzers, as they are associated with factors that play an important role in the influence of social media content to its audience. These aspects are nowadays strongly taken into account by organizations that want to draw the public's attention to the content they deliver, and in this context cultural institutions have already started to take under great consideration not only their presence in social media, but also the monitoring and exploitation of social media dynamics. In this paper we propose a method that can enable cultural venues to benefit from matches between their own content and ongoing discussions on social media. More specifically we extract trending topics that can be related semantically with the content of a cultural institute and examine how a venue can benefit by exploiting these matches. The proposed approach has been developed in the scope of the ""CrossCult"" H2020 project, and has been experimentally tested by analyzing the case of Twitter in Greek language. © 2018 IEEE."

Emojis have become quintessential elements of social media communication; yet, their role in supporting persuasion attempts has not been systematically analysed. Drawing on general rhetoric literature, this paper dissects, portrays and labels social media influencers’ persuasive attempts to initiate engagement through emojis. The focus on influencers is justified because of their dual roles as marketers and active social media users. 600 Weibo posts by the top 200 Weibo influencers were collected to develop a taxonomy of emoji-based verbal moves aimed at encouraging responses in followers. The resulting taxonomy demonstrates that emoji use by social media influencers is complex and strategic and serves multiple persuasive and communicative purposes. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd."

Influencer in this context refers to a social media user who is popular and has a high amount of followers. Through social media, it is now possible for a larger number of people to communicate with one another about products as well as the companies that are involved in their production. The problem that has been existing in social media marketing now is that it is difficult to determine the efficiency of influencers on how well they are able to promote the product. Having large amount of followers does not guarantee the influencer is efficient in promoting the product. Thus, there is a need for metrics to measure the efficiency of influencers. The Social Influencer Database System project consists of three main parts, namely a web scraping algorithm, a database, and a web application. The purpose of the algorithm is to determine the efficiency of the influencers while the web application provides a platform for brand owners and influencers to interact with each other. This study has been done with the aim of gaining a wider range of knowledge of how to determine the efficiency of influencers. Research has been done about related case studies and existing algorithms to get a better understanding of how to use available metrics such as likes, comments and followers, to calculate the engagement rate of influencers in the most accurate way. Brand owners can then select the most efficient influencer to advertise their product. The algorithm formulated in this study has been applied to Instagram data. The use of an influencer can greatly enhance the outcome of digital marketing. Hence, a proper measurement of efficiency must be done in order to produce the best outcome. © 2018 IEEE."

While online discussion platforms are available in the form of applications and websites, an emergent outcome of this transformation is the phenomenon of 'opinion leaders'. A number of previous studies have been presented to identify opinion leaders in online discussion networks. In particular, Feng (2016 Comput. Hum. Behav. 54, 43-53. (doi:10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.052)) has identified five different types of central users besides outlining their communication patterns in an online communication network. However, the presented work focuses on a limited time span. The question remains as to whether similar communication patterns exist that will stand the test of time over longer periods. Here, we present a critical analysis of the Feng framework both for short-term as well as for longer periods. Additionally, for validation, we take another case study presented by Udanor et al. (2016 Program 50, 481-507. (doi:10.1108/PROG-02-2016-0011)) to further understand these dynamics. Results indicate that not all Feng-based central users may be identifiable in the longer term. Conversation starter and influencers were noted as opinion leaders in the network. These users play an important role as information sources in long-term discussions. Whereas network builder and active engager help in connecting otherwise sparse communities. Furthermore, we discuss the changing positions of opinion leaders and their power to keep isolates interested in an online discussion network. © 2018 The Authors."

Material and methods: Twitter searched for #circumcision hashtag via www.tweetarchivist.com, www.twitonomy.com, www.symplur.com. Total tweet numbers, most influencers, top users were documented. Tweets including female circumcision were excluded. The contents of the tweets were classified into four subgroups (medical, religious, social, and political) by two independent reviewers. All kinds of tweet activities were statistically analyzed. Results: A total of 9795 users generated 15,989 tweets about circumcision in a 1 month period. Mean daily tweet activity was 532 for #circumcision. The content analysis revealed that 2224 (15.8%) medical, 1133 (8.0%) religious, 323 (2.2%) social and 10,470 (74.0%) political tweets have been sent out by the users. Contributors originated from 174 countries from 6 continents. Media organizations were accounted for 52% of the top 25 influencers in circumcision hashtag. The most common hashtags accompanying #circumcision were #HIV (4.9%), #babiesgotherpes (3.3%), #muslim (1.8%), #malegenitalmutilation (1.6%) respectively. Conclusions: There is an increasing discussion about circumcision through SoMe. Our results provided that the discussion points are mostly driven by the media and the activists.

This aspect of information seeking is important, especially for people affected by chronic pathologies and require lifelong treatment and management. These people are usually very well informed about the disease but are nonetheless vulnerable to hopes of being cured or saved, often amplified by misinformation, myths, legends, and therapies that are not always scientifically proven. Many studies suggest that some individuals prefer to rely on the Internet as their main source of information, often hindering the patient-doctor relationship. A professional approach is imperative to maintain confidentiality, honesty, and trust in the medical profession. Objective: we aimed to examine, in a medically supervised Italian web community (SMsocialnetwotk.com) dedicated to people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), the posts shared by users and to verify the reliability of contents of posts shared by users pinpointed as Influencers through an online questionnaire. Methods: we grouped the posts published on SMsocialnetwork from April to June 2015 into those with medical content (scientifically correct or fake news), and those related to social interactions. Later, we gave a questionnaire to the community asking to identify the three users/Influencers providing the most reliable advice for everyday life with MS and the three users/Influencers providing the most useful information about MS treatments. Results: 308 posts reported scientific and relevant medical information, whereas 72 posts included pieces of fake news. 1420 posts were of general interest. Four out of the 6 Influencers had written only posts with correct medical information (3 were pwMS, 1 was a Neurologist) and never any fake news. The remaining 2 appointed Influencers (2 pwMS) had written only posts about general interests. Conclusion: the identification of fake news and their authors has shown that the latter are never appointed as Influencers. SMsocialnetwork.com acted as a “web safe environment” where the Influencers contributed by sharing only correct medical information and never fake news. We speculate that the presence of neurologists and psychologists supervising the information flow might have contributed to reduce the risk of fake news spreading and to avoid their acquisition of authoritative meaning. © 2018"

Several measures for identifying influencers have been proposed, and the effectiveness of these influence measures has been evaluated for the case where the complete social network structure is known. However, it is difficult in practice to obtain the complete structure of a social network because of missing data, false data, or node/link sampling from the social network. In this paper, we investigate the effects of node sampling from a social network on the effectiveness of influence measures at identifying influencers. Our experimental results show that the negative effect of biased sampling, such as sample edge count, on the identification of influencers is generally small. For social media networks, we can identify influencers whose influence is comparable with that of those identified from the complete social networks by sampling only 10%–30% of the networks. Moreover, our results also suggest the possible benefit of network sampling in the identification of influencers. Our results show that, for some networks, nodes with higher influence can be discovered from sampled social networks than from complete social networks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

In addition to mass communication and direct advertising, brands today can cooperate with social media influencers to target potential consumers via third parties who are less institutionalised and thus highly credible. Although the two-step flow of communication is well established in communication research, social media technology has clearly fuelled the role of opinion leaders (‘influencers’) with respect to brand recommendations. In recent years, however, influencer communication has undergone a process of professionalisation, leading to differentiation in terms of roles, content and audience behaviour. This study combines observational data of influencers’ followers with data from a content analysis of influencers’ YouTube posts and a representative survey of their audience. The results show that influencers’ communication is no longer restricted to certain categories and that their followers seek gratification through the consumption of social media content in very much the same way as with traditional media content. The study also shows that advertising is omnipresent but also consciously anticipated and accepted by followers if certain conditions are fulfilled. © Henry Stewart Publications."

As such, it is critical to understand how information is transmitted and dispersed through outlets such as Twitter, particularly in emergency situations where there is an urgent need to relay scientific information. The purpose of this study is to examine how original tweets and retweets on Twitter were used to diffuse radiation related information after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. Out of the Twitter database, we purchased all tweets (including replies) and retweets related to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident and or radiation sent from March 2 nd , 2011 to September 15 th , 2011. This time frame represents the first six months after the East Japan earthquake, which occurred on March 11 th , 2011. Using the obtained data, we examined the number of tweets and retweets and found that only a small number of Twitter users were the source of the original posts that were retweeted during the study period. We have termed these specific accounts as “influencers”. We identified the top 100 influencers and classified the contents of their tweets into 3 groups by analyzing the document vectors of the text. Then, we examined the number of retweets for each of the 3 groups of influencers, and created a retweet network diagram to assess how the contents of their tweets were being spread. The keyword “radiation” was mentioned in over 24 million tweets and retweets during the study period. Retweets accounted for roughly half (49.7%) of this number, and the top 2% of Twitter accounts defined as “influencers” were the source of the original posts that accounted for 80.3% of the total retweets. The majority of the top 100 influencers had individual Twitter accounts bearing real names. While retweets were intensively diffused within a fixed population, especially within the same groups with similar document vectors, a group of influencers accounted for the majority of retweets one month after the disaster, and the share of each group did not change even after proven scientific information became more available. © 2018 Tsubokura et al.

Companies are required to act ethically and in an environmentally responsible manner. They are also finding that to be successful they need to offer more customised products and experiences. All of this has resulted in a new paradigm for brands and branding. Brands now need to be more Agile in order to compete in a dynamic environment, adaption and evolution is imperative to keep up with consumers' growing demands and an ever-changing marketplace. This change still needs to be rooted in strong strategy and defining principles however, and brands need to be clear on who they are and what they stand for in order to ensure as they adapt, they also stay true to what makes them unique and useful to their customers. This new agile way of thinking facilitates the need to create brand communities as we seek to create a dialogue with our end customers and co-create solutions that are highly tailored and relevant. Technology will continue to play an increasing role as we move from simple customisation to Artificial Intelligence and a higher degree of utility in what we provide consumers. Consumers will expect more and brands will need to evolve to survive. With the evolution of branding, naturally comes the evolution of brand touchpoints. Traditional brand touchpoints, whilst still in play, now encompass a myriad of new ways to engage with consumer. The customer journey is no longer linear, but an omni-channel experience made up of every interaction with your brand, from social media influencers to digital chatbots. Each of these touchpoints enhances the customer experience - driving engagement, equity and loyalty for your brand. Today's organisations are facing unprecedented levels of change and as such, need to follow a new playbook when considering how to activate their brand through every touch point and interaction with their consumers. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

While this is of interest in many different contexts, companies currently face this issue from a business perspective with the rise of influencer marketing. One of the most pressing questions in this field is how to measure success. Quantitative success metrics (e.g., number of likes) are mostly readily available and also predominantly used by both influencers themselves and companies. Still, it remains unclear what value these metrics actually have for influencer marketing and whether they are an appropriate proxy for the quality of the content. This is of special interest, as companies have only limited control over the content posted by influencers. We contribute to this area of research by combining secondary data on influencer marketing campaigns from Instagram with an online survey among marketing professionals. We find that in general, professionals consider an influencer’s reach and their number of interactions as the most important success metrics. In contrast, when professionals are facing a tradeoff between multiple metrics, they predominantly rely on the sentiment of user comments. We run a regression analysis showing that only the sentiment measure is positively related to the professional evaluation of the content, thus questioning the use of common quantitative metrics to evaluate social media influencers. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s)."

Vaping companies use SMIs who are known only to the collective group of like-minded peers to create a loyal audience. The present study uses research from the SSSW and PSIs to understand persuasive cues while watching a video featuring an SMI. © 2018, © 2018 American Academy of Advertising."

Targeting the users who cost the viral burst in social media among the enormous users producing messages every second is a difficult job. If such influencers can be identified in real time when trends are happening, some incidents can be prevented, protected and even drawn benefits from. Identifying influencers can be done with data classification techniques. Our research proposes a technique for identifying influencers on Twitter social media platform using extracted features from six months of collected tweets from November 2016 to March 2017. The proposed method contains two types of feature which are static and dynamic features. The static features include the weekday, the time period of the first retweet, and its author's numbers of interaction and relation consist of retweets of the hashtag, followers, followings, friends, favorites, and statuses. The dynamic features are the changes in the author's numbers of interaction and relation since the first retweet to a target time. The features were extracted according to a period of time according to Bursting State and bursting duration of 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Four ensemble classification algorithms: Bagging, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Voting were applied. The results demonstrate that Bagging algorithm yields the best results in general for a duration of 120 minutes, and even identifying influencers in the separated topic domain, it also yields better predictive results. © 2018 IEEE."

Approximately 3500 infants die from SIDS and sleep-related reasons on a yearly basis. Unintentional sleep-related deaths and bed sharing, a known risk factor for SIDS, are on the rise. Furthermore, ethnic disparities exist among those most affected by SIDS. Despite public health campaigns, infant mortality persists. Given the popularity of social media, understanding social media conversations around SIDS and safe sleep may assist the medical and public health communities with information needed to spread, reinforce, or counteract false information regarding SIDS and safe sleep. Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the social media conversation around SIDS and safe sleep to understand the possible influences and guide health promotion efforts and public health research as well as enable health professionals to engage in directed communication regarding this topic. Methods: We used textual analytics to identify topics and extract meanings contained in unstructured textual data. Twitter messages were captured during September, October, and November in 2017. Tweets and retweets were collected using NUVI software in conjunction with Twitter's search API using the keywords: “sids,” “infant death syndrome,” “sudden infant death syndrome,” and “safe sleep.” This returned a total of 41,358 messages, which were analyzed using text mining and social media monitoring software. Results: Multiple themes were identified, including recommendations for safe sleep to prevent SIDS, safe sleep devices, the potential causes of SIDS, and how breastfeeding reduces SIDS. Compared with September and November, more personal and specific stories of infant loss were demonstrated in October (Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month). The top influencers were news organizations, universities, and health-related organizations. Conclusions: We identified valuable topics discussed and shared on Twitter regarding SIDS and safe sleep. The study results highlight the contradicting information a subset of the population is exposed to regarding SIDS and the continued controversy over vaccines. In addition, this analysis emphasizes the lack of public health organizations' presence on Twitter compared with the influence of universities and news media organizations. The results also demonstrate the prevalence of safe sleep products that are embedded in safe sleep messaging. These findings can assist providers in speaking about relevant topics when engaging in conversations about the prevention of SIDS and the promotion of safe sleep. Furthermore, public health agencies and advocates should utilize social media and Twitter to better communicate accurate health information as well as continue to combat the spread of false information. © Kelly A Pretorius, Michael Mackert, Gary B Wilcox.

Social media Influencers especially YouTube content creators are used to communicate with the public using videos and podcasts. “As social media platforms expand and evolve, the advertising industry has had to change and adapt to continue to reach consumers. With social media growing in influence and advertising agencies allocating more of their media budgets to social, the advertising industry is in search of effective strategies to get the most return on investment when it comes to social. One of these strategies in recent years has been influencer marketing, which is a form of marketing where the focus is placed on specific individuals rather than a target market as a whole. It identifies the individuals that have influence over potential buyers, and orients marketing activities around these influencers.” The paper aims to study the role of YouTube as a social media platform and its impact on creating visibility for brands and to determine the effect of the views/opinions of You-Tubers on its viewers. It also explains the various promotional tools used by the content creators to effectively reach their viewers. A survey among 300 urban women you-tube viewers in Mysuru between the age 20-35 was proposed for this paper. The objectives of this paper would be to analyze the authenticity of the content generated by bloggers; to analyze the PR strategies used different brands, to understand the consumer behavior when it comes to buy a product marketed through blogs and to examine the role of bloggers in fashion industry. The study is based on Social Media Impact theory that states that “professionals must position themselves to benefit from fundamental changes that are occurring in the ways people decide on which products and services to consume, and how they actually consume them” (Mir & Zaheer, 2012). This paper would help to understand the rise in the use of social media fashion bloggers and as the storytellers of a brand and it’s products. “Fashion bloggers are fast becoming an influential force within the fashion industry, which has been facilitated by the growth of new media.” However the study is limited to a few respondents from Mysuru and is subjective to researcher’s and respondents understanding. © IAEME Publication."

Data was obtained from a random sample of 277 individuals and subjected to statistical analyses. By studying two different celebrities that come from a different race, gender, and background, we found that our findings and significance values changed depending on which celebrity was tested. Our findings indicated that ads that evoke positive emotions are more likely to convert to donations. Demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and income also affect donations. In some cases, the nonprofit’s cause and advertising message were powerful enough to override the impact of the celebrity. Our findings can help marketers style their ads to evoke certain emotions, by using celebrity endorsers that will help them increase donations. Furthermore, understanding what drives donors will help nonprofits tailor marketing strategies.

However, while empirical experimental evidence has shown that network assortativity and the joint distribution of influence and susceptibility are important mechanisms shaping social influence, most current influence maximization models do not incorporate these features. Here, we specify a class of empirically motivated influence models and study their implications for influence maximization in six synthetic and six real social networks of varying sizes and structures. We find that ignoring assortativity and the joint distribution of influence and susceptibility leads traditional models to underestimate influence propagation by 21.7% on average, for a fixed seed set size. The traditional models and the empirical types that we specify here also identify substantially different seed sets, with only 19.8% overlap between them. The optimal seeds chosen under empirical influence models are relatively less well-connected and less central nodes, and they have more cohesive, embedded ties with their contacts. Hence, empirically motivated influence models have the potential to identify more realistic sets of key influencers in a social network and inform intervention designs that disseminate information or change attitudes and behaviours. © 2018 The Author(s)."

Material and methods: The use of Twitter from 2013 to 2016 was monitored at the congresses of the Spanish Association of Surgeons (AEC). To do this, the hashtags (# rnc13, # cnc14, # rnc15, # cncirugia16) were analyzed through various websites for analysis of hashtags. Results: The use of Twitter among the members of the Spanish Association of Surgeons has increased clearly, surpassing other American societies. It has increased in number of tweets, in number of tweeters and in the ratio of the same with respect to those attending congresses. While at the beginning the majority of tweets (65%) were the responsibility of a group of influencers, in recent years, due to the increase in tweets, the maximum influencers are only responsible for 35% of tweets. The number of institutional accounts in the top 10 has also been reduced. Conclusion: n the AEC the use of twitter has grown clearly and almost exponentially in recent years. Although initially the tweeted community was small and a few were responsible for a majority of tweets, the progressive growth and penetration of twitter has made that in recent congresses, these influencers and institutional accounts are no longer the main driver of the use of twitter in the congresses.

In this paper, we propose a method capable of finding influential users by exploiting the contents of the messages posted by them to express opinions on items, by modeling these contents with a three-layer network. Layers represent users, items, and keywords, along with intra-layer interactions among the actors of the same layer. Inter-layer connections are triples (u, i, k) expressing the information that a user u comments on an item i by using a keyword k. By exploiting multilinear algebra, we present a method capable of extracting the most active users stating their point of view about dominant items tagged with dominant keywords. We conduct a series of experiments on different real-world datasets collected from Twitter and Yelp Social Networks about different topics. Experimental results show the ability of our approach to find influential users that are both authoritative in the user network and very active in posting opinions about the topic of interest. © 1999-2012 IEEE."

The proposed framework details the partner brand's social media power potential (size and activity of the social media network), social media power exertion (different posting behaviors and comments), and their interaction. The authors test this framework with an extensive data set from the film industry, in which films function as composite products and actors represent partner brands. The data set features 442 movies, including 1,318 actor-movie combinations and weekly social media data (including 41,547 coded Facebook posts).

However, managers and firms need to choose which opinion leaders to work with and better understand how to collaborate with those leaders to promote different types of products and services. Online opinion leaders should be used to promote the experiential (hedonic) and functional (utilitarian) value of products and services over different online forums. In this article, we describe how online opinion leaders can serve appeal leadership functions, serve knowledge leadership functions, and take multiple roles (e.g., experts, celebrities, micro-celebrities, micro-influencers, early adopters, market mavens, enthusiasts). We then present a five-stage planning process designed to guide partnerships with online opinion leaders. Specific steps in the process include: planning (setting the objectives of the campaign and the role of online opinion leaders), recognition (identifying influential and relevant online opinion leaders), alignment (matching online opinion leaders and online forums with the products or services promoted), motivation (rewarding online opinion leaders in a way that aligns with their social role), and coordination (negotiating, monitoring, and supporting the influence of the online opinion leaders). © 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University"

Media studies have analyzed influencers’ display of the luxurious life to which ordinary women can only aspire. Applying a quantitative method to previous findings, this study examined the psychological process through which social media use and personality traits affect females’ envy toward influencers through social comparison. Specifically, this study tested whether social media use variables (exposure to influencers’ social media, interest in specific content on influencers’ social media) and personality traits (public self-consciousness and self-esteem) are associated with the frequency of comparison of one’s life with that of influencers, which, in turn, predict envy toward them. A two-wave online survey was conducted in South Korea (N = 1,064 at Wave 1 and 782 at Wave 2) among female smartphone users aged 20–39. A path analysis revealed that all four independent variables at Wave 1 indirectly influenced envy at Wave 2 through social comparison at Wave 1, when envy at Wave 1 was controlled for. The findings extended the scope of social comparison theory and provided a critical view of influencers’ self-representation from a feminist perspective. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Readers can directly contact their favourite authors, and publishers, through social media and become authors, and publishers, themselves. One of the outcomes of digital reading and writing is that writing is now becoming more democratic: traditional publishers are no longer the sole gatekeepers of culture. The popularity of social writing platform Wattpad is a recent example of how a new generation of influential and innovative writers is entering the publishing arena. This also demonstrates that there is a demand for authorship without the intervention from publishers. Despite this, traditional notions of authorship, ownership and control are prevalent in contemporary publishing hindering the true potential of creativity. The disharmony between the rise of the amateur author and the control of the traditional publisher is confronted in the digital public sphere. Consequently, issues such as authority and influence are mediated during the activities and interactions that take place on social media and other online platforms. Established authority figures, such as famous authors or well-known publishers, that exert authority and influence in the traditional sphere, can shift this authority and influence to the digital world; however, this sphere is also occupied by emerging networks of influencers, such as emerging authors or micro-celebrities, who gain popularity as a result of specific trends, in specific domains, at specific times. This article will examine how new and established authors are using social platforms, and social media, to publish their writing, build communities and extend their dialogue with readers and other writers. A netnographic study of Wattpad will identify which authors are the influencers and innovators in social publishing. Consequently, this article will underscore the increasing importance of social networks and social relationships in 21st century publishing. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016."

The approach gives researchers unique insight into the main groups involved and their agendas. While the individual pieces of the methodology are not new, the way in which we combine them will be novel to many market researchers. By connecting Twitter users that interact with each other into an “interaction network” or “conversation map” and using community detection algorithms to isolate distinct groups, we are able to identify the main constituencies discussing a specific topic such as a national election. Once the main constituencies have been identified, it is possible to profile them in more detail such as in terms of their demographics, their influencers, and the type of content that resonates with them. This article specifically focuses on roughly one million tweets about the 2014 South African national election to illustrate our approach. The authors believe that the approach described has wide-ranging applications and that it can be used to give researchers unprecedented insight into the public discourse surrounding specific topics and events.

In Catalonia, where 85 percent of parliamentarians have a Twitter account, two questions emerge from this new social phenomenon. First, who are the opinion leaders of the parliamentarians’ online political networks, and second, do the characteristics of the Members of Parliament’ (MPs’) Twitter networks and the attributes of the parliamentarians influence the likelihood of forming communication ties? This article seeks to ascertain whether social media are challenging party politics and leadership in communication flows in Parliament. We used a social network analysis of relationships among the Catalan parliamentarians with Twitter accounts (115 of the 135 members) to reveal the potential influencers of the following–follower network. Exponential Random Graph models were employed to determine the endogenous (network) and exogenous (node attributes) factors facilitating MPs’ communication ties. We found evidence that Catalan MPs’ communication ties arise from network dynamics (reciprocity and popularity) and from MPs’ political position. We also discovered that new potential influencers, who are not official party leaders and do not play important roles in Parliament, are emerging as brokers within the Catalan parliamentary Twitter network. © 2017 The Authors.

Users can even share live streams whenever they want to reach out to many other. This prevalent usage of social media attracted companies, data scientists, and researchers who are trying to infer meaningful information from this vast amount of data. Information diffusion and maximizing the spread of words is one of the most important focus for researchers working on social media. This information can serve many purposes such as; user or content recommendation, viral marketing, and user modeling. In this research, finding topical influential/authority users on Twitter is addressed. Since Twitter is a good platform to spread knowledge as a word of mouth approach and it has many more public profiles than protected ones, it is a target media for marketers. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, called Personalized PageRank, that integrates both the information obtained from network topology and the information obtained from user actions and activities in Twitter. The proposed approach aims to determine the topical influencers who are experts on a specific topic. Experimental results on a large dataset consisting of Turkish tweets show that using user specific features like topical focus rate, activeness, authenticity and speed of getting reaction on specific topics positively affects identifying influencers and lead to higher information diffusion.

Recently, with the growth in online consumption, brands are increasingly forming alliances with individuals who act as social influencers and operate online via social media channels. For example, L’Oréal launched a makeup line in partnership with Michelle Phan, a YouTube blogger with over 8 million subscribers. The primary role of these online influencers is to extend a brand’s reach. Consumers are believed to rely on personal recommendations from the online influencers they follow and admire, for their purchasing decisions (Godes and Mayzlin, 2004). These influencers are also suggested to shape consumers perceptions (Lee and Watkins, 2016). Given the impact of word-of-mouth and peer recommendations on consumer decision-making (e.g. Berger, 2014), brand alliances with online influencers are an increasingly important part of brands’ marketing strategy. In addition, the pervasiveness of social media and its ever-increasing influence on how consumers think and behave has created the need for an enhanced understanding of such human-computer interactions. The impact of the alliance between a brand and an online influencer on brand attitudes, consumer value, and purchase intention, however, is not yet understood. Aiming to address the above gap, this study examines the impact of digital brand alliances on consumers’ value perceptions and on their willingness to buy. The study employed a scenario-based experiment consisting of five real-life digital brand alliances (beauty, travel, food, gaming, and fashion). For data collection, a self-administered questionnaire was designed embedding the five scenarios to represent each brand alliance category. Respondents included a convenience-based sample of UK consumers, (49% female, 51% males, all aged 18+). The data were analysed with partial least squares-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) employing SmartPLS 3.0 (Ringle et al., 2014). The results show considerable explanatory and predictive power of the model. The study findings reveal that digital brand alliances have a significant and positive influence on all four dimensions of consumer value, which, in turn, influence purchase intention. The findings also demonstrate that reference group influence has a moderating effect on the relationship between digital brand alliances and consumer value perceptions. For those consumers who are influenced by the opinions of others, brands should ensure that the alliance is with a favourable online personality. For those who are not influenced by others, however, brands should focus on building a positive attitude towards the brand. Moreover, for consumers with high RGI, brands should explicitly communicate value for money, in order to encourage purchase. The study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature streams on brand alliance and consumer value perceptions. First, it investigates the impact of digital brand alliance towards consumer value perceptions and purchase intention, which has been largely overlooked in extant research. Second, it furthers knowledge on how digital brand alliances shape the way consumers evaluate brands. In sum, this research offers support for assumptions about the efficacy of digital brand alliance, across different product categories. Future research could examine how other factors such as brand loyalty and self-image can impact the effect digital brand alliances has on consumer value perceptions and purchase intention. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science."

A series of interview from three Internet celebrities and three followers of each celebrity were conducted to enrich this study. The results show that Internet celebrities are people who have become famous by means of Internet, and have the ability to influence others.

This essay examines the process of co-evolution of digital influencers and audiences by taking into consideration the work of female curvy fashion bloggers. It is argued that, although plus-size social media influencers may play a counter-hegemonic role by conveying alternative narratives regarding body and beauty, many curvy blogs are not significantly different to ""standard"" female outfit blogs, in which an audience is commodified as a source of material income and symbolic capital. Digital influencers, therefore, work as examples of co-opted audiences able to enhance further processes of co-option. The article also studies the social media influencers relationships with their audiences, focusing attention on the manner through which the blogger produces, develops and maintains this relationship. Cultural studies and political economy perspectives on public are discussed to contextualize the analysis of curvy blogs, as fashion studies have so far shown a limited interest in audience as an issue. The qualitative empirical material of the essay, made of 15 semi-structured interviews with female curvy bloggers and the content analysis of 40 curvy blogs, is analysed according to a grounded theory framework. Three main theoretical dimensions are discussed: The blogger s career, success and professionalization, their faceted role in the process of audience shaping and the (reframed) narratives of beauty and body they spread. Drawing on a typology of curvy bloggers, the antinomy between ""commodifying the audience"" and ""challenging the mainstream"" is presented as a misleading way of interpreting the phenomenon, as the commercialisation of attention and the engagement of followers work as powerful and connected poles of a continuum. © 2018 Obercom.

The influencer campaign was launched in conjunction with its sponsorship of the Andretti Formula E team, and was paired with an incentive — a sweepstake to win a trip to Andretti Autosport to see the engineering behind motorsports and an exclusive lunch with Michael Andretti, team owner and former champion race car driver. YouTuber Jason Fenske, creator of the channel Engineering Explained, flew to the United Kingdom to learn and film three videos about TE’s involvement in Formula E, the first all-electric international street car race series, and its parallels to the increasing consumer electric vehicle trend. With over 100 TE products in a Formula E car and a major player in the automotive industry, the racetrack-to-the-road thematic videos were concepted and produced to attract engineers from diverse industries and across the business spectrum. The success of Engineering Explained led to influencer programmes with TE’s sponsorship of rLoop, a crowdsourced team of engineers participating in Elon Musk’s SpaceX Hyperloop Competition. Leading up to and during the first competition, TE produced a five-part documentary chronicling the formation of the team, the technology and the excitement of the challenge to create the fifth mode of transport, which was amplified to an engineering audience through a multi-influencer distribution strategy. During the second competition, a YouTube influencer, Linus Tech Tips, travelled to California to film a 20-minute Facebook Live segment the night before the competition to capture the tension, nerves and excitement as the rLoop team put the finishing touches on their prototype, and produced a post-competition YouTube video on the technology of the Hyperloop. This paper comprises a practitioner’s insights into and lessons learned from activating B2B influencer programmes. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS."

The study focused on the predominant debate between the pro-gun and anti-gun activists in the United States. Such factors as data bias, ambiguity, and inaccuracies may occur when either feuding party shares data on gun violence statistics through twitter. The researchers adopted a veracity assessment synthesized from previous studies, which focuses on three main aspects 1) objectivity/subjectivity 2) truthfulness/deception, 3) credibility/implausibility. The preliminary research focused on finding data influencers on twitter through the NodeXL application and studying their tweets through content/text analysis.

This article aims to determine the factors leading to either positive or negative communication about brands on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and brand-related blogs based on a representative sample from Germany and the US, each with 1,000 adults. Complementary to an analysis of factors determining a general inclination to recommend, a principal component analysis of the diverse motives to do so exhibits patterns being largely consistent in a crosscultural perspective, however, with differences in specific practices concerning gender, age, and formal education.

Written in an accessible style, but with endnotes as necessary, it is a call to more and deeper critical thinking about media, old and new, as well as a consideration of the communicative needs of a present and future movement for transformative political and economic change. Our media systems, many scholars argue, have moved from an economics of information to an economics of attention, whereby getting us to look, to click, is the constant and central objective. Donald Trump got our attention, all over the world, like perhaps no one has ever done before. Ironically, for all that he is a symptom of democratic and media decay, he is also the nearest thing we have had to a centre point for a global public sphere. The first of the book introduces the public sphere as an historic idea and ideal, a place where proto-democratic and even truly democratic subjects deliberate and ensure civil society has a voice at the table of state. It challenges that idea, in terms of its theoretical limitations and elisions and its ultimately technocratic-consensual model of how politics works, its evasion of 'the ineradicability of antagonism'. This examines, among other things, what we can and can't learn by looking at media behaviour through the lens of its proprietors' commercial interests. The biases of broadcasters and newspapers in the recent economic crisis are considered, along with the pressures and consequences of declining print circulation and migration of advertising online, as well as some initial questions about pluralism and the continuing important role of the public service media, in Ireland and elsewhere. This chapter includes an extensive review of previously unpublished results of a study into newspaper coverage of the Irish movement against the Iraq war. The final part of the book moves the discussion online, where, though nearly infinite pluralism appears to rule the day, power and freedom are more elusive. Under the regime of 'communicative capitalism', we are all 'content providers', generally without remuneration - unless we are lucky enough to be bestowed with the neological title of 'social influencers'. © Harry Browne 2018.

Their opinions have a powerful impact on people, especially on young generation. We can mark them as a modern phenomenon that has seen a huge increase in cooperation with marketing agencies over recent years. More and more people are following such influencers so that they do not miss out on their content. Brands flock to such influencers for mentions, reviews and recommendations. Even though influencer marketing is a relatively new strategy, it continues to be a viable solution for marketers who are willing to think outside the box while building relationships with their target market. The aim of the study is to offer a comprehensive reflection on influencer marketing opportunities and determine the impact of influencers on consumer behaviour of Generations Y and Z. We wanted to find out whether influencers, who promote products, can attract potential customers and encourage them for purchase, as well as find differences between the given consumer generations. In order to meet the objectives of the study, own research was conducted (459 respondents from the Slovak Republic belonging to Generations Y and Z were involved in the inquiry). The research findings confirm that there are significant differences between the above-mentioned consumer generations in the area of impact of influencers on consumer behaviour, which leads to different marketing opportunities.

We look at the case of SofiaBBeauty, a successful young Portuguese youtuber, who has been vlogging since she was 12.

We explore the way Sofia connects her self-presentation with products/brands to appear close to her young audiences, and brands her persona as she is growing up to adulthood; how she presents her commercial recommendations as genuine and pregnant with affect, and whether the audience accepts it or not; as well as how she positions herself in the global YouTube community of practice, where connection with brands aggrandizes her persona in the eyes of the audience.

Disinformation can either increase the uncertainty of the available information or can entirely deceive a person. Hence, depending on the decision-making level, there can be severe consequences. At the mass audience and lay population levels (as opposed to the level of key influencers), disinformation can be disseminated very rapidly. The populations at these two levels are more susceptible to disinformation because they use social media, and mass communication media to access information. However, it is difficult to monitor and identify disinformation in this open access environment. As a result, people who are exposed to disinformation may develop cognitive schemas which, in turn, may constrain their future information seeking. Information seeking is a cognitive exercise that is applied when people are confronted with uncertainty. But a cognitive schema influenced by disinformation can result in organizational dysfunction or can deceive lay decision makers in daily activities, such as voting, toward the desire of an adversary. This paper investigates the lay-population disinformation vulnerability problem in three ways: First, from the perspective of cyber warfare in which social media can be a major battle field to mobilize vulnerable populations towards the desired end. Second, an analysis of conceptual modeling problems and issues. Third, a proposed preliminary mathematical model of the cognitive schema to further illuminate the impact of disinformation. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

In social media and thus also in SLSSs, the so-called influencer and micro-celebrities play an important role, but to what extend are SLSSs’ streamers motivated by fame or financial gain? We conducted a content analysis in order to investigate SLSSs’ streamers (n = 7,667) on Periscope, Ustream and YouNow in respect to their general characteristics and streaming motivation being fame and financial gain. We have developed a research model referring to the platform used by the streamers, their gender, origin, age and streamed content (general characteristics), as well as the motivational aspects. Streamers of Ustream are mostly motivated by financial gain, whereas YouNow broadcasters seek to be famous. Considering the streamers age, older generations (Gen X, Silver Surfers) aspire after financial gain. With progressing age the motivation to become a star decreases. Mostly streamed content by streamers motivated by money is entertainment media. For streamers wanting to become a star chatting and making music are the preferred content categories. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature."

In fact, tweets enable users to express opinions about products and to influence other users. Thus, the identification of social network key influencers with their products perception and preferences is crucial to enable marketers to apply effective techniques of viral marketing and recommendation. In this paper, we propose a methodology, based on multilinear algebra, that combines topological and contextual information to identify the most influential twitterers of specific topics or products along with their perceptions and opinions about them. Experiments on a real use case regarding smartphones show the ability of the proposed methodology to find users that are authoritative in the social network in expressing their views about products and to identify the most relevant products for these users, along with the opinions they express.

This study aims to extend the fundamental influence maximisation problem (IMP) with respect to a set of target users on a social network. It is important to aim at the target users to speed up the rate of information diffusion and reduce the information diffusion cost. In doing so, the MITU algorithm was formulated and compared with state of the art algorithms. Publicly available datasets were used in validating the proposed algorithm. It was found that the MITU identified all target nodes while significantly lowering the information diffusion cost function (IDCF) by up to 79%. The influence overlap problem was equally identified in the heuristic algorithm where the seed set size was reduced by an average of six times. Furthermore, the random influencer selection identifies target nodes better than the betweenness and PageRank centralities. The findings could help organisations to reach target users on social media in the shortest cycle. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka. All Rights Reserved."

To fill this gap, this chapter develops a conceptual framework to examine the impact of the endorsement by social media influencers on online brand engagement. The authors use social distance theories to construct several propositions to provide a deep understanding. They suggest that traditional celebrities and social media influencers have different social distance, therefore generate different types and degrees of consumer online engagement. And the product characteristics moderate the effectiveness of the different types of celebrity endorsement. © 2018 by IGI Global. All rights reserved."

The data was collected from a non-governmental organization fan page (NGOFP) and a significant civilian fan page (ICFP) on Facebook using NodeXL. The two datasets contained 296 posts which generated different network structures based on the state of the flood, information available, and the needs of the information. Through content analysis, five common themes emerged from the information exchanges for both fan pages which helped in providing material and psychological support to the flood victims.

This article focused on unlocking the potential of the #AlphaGo hashtag network by addressing the following questions. First, the current study examined whether traditional opinion leadership (i.e., the influentials hypothesis) or grassroot participation by the public (i.e., the interpersonal hypothesis) drove dissemination of information in the hashtag network. Second, several unique patterns of information distribution by key users were identified. Finally, the association between attributes of key users who exerted great influence on information distribution (i.e., the number of followers and follows) and their central status in the network was tested. To answer the proffered research questions, a social network analysis was conducted using a large-scale hashtag network data set from Twitter (n = 21,870). The results showed that the leading actors in the network were actively receiving information from their followers rather than serving as intermediaries between the original information sources and the public. Moreover, the leading actors played several roles (i.e., conversation starters, influencers, and active engagers) in the network. Furthermore, the number of their follows and followers were significantly associated with their central status in the hashtag network. Based on the results, the current research explained how the information was exchanged in the hashtag network by proposing the reciprocal model of information flow. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

It has been further seen that such engagements result in huge amount of user-generated content (UGC) from both individuals and organizations combined. This UGC can be analyzed in multiple ways to mine useful information. One such popular domain that uses this information is content buzz/popularity. The content shared on social media platforms becomes popular and subsequently viral when shared and propagated by a larger audience at a faster pace. Organizations are leveraging this power of social media in the domain of content buzz and virality by employing various buzz monitoring techniques to boost the reach of their content. This study thus proposes a hybrid artificial bee colony approach integrated with k-nearest neighbors to identify and segregate buzz in Twitter. A set of metrics comprising of created discussions, increase in authors, attention level, burstiness level, contribution sparseness, author interaction, author count and average length of discussions are used to model the buzz. The proposed approach considers the buzz discussions as outliers deviating from the normal discussions and identifies the same using the proposed hybrid bio-inspired approach. Findings may be useful in domains like e-commerce, digital and influencer marketing to explore the factors that might create buzz along with the difference between the impact of buzz and normal discussions on the consumers. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria."

Social network analysis can be adopted to understand the flow of information between virtual social communities and the role of patients within the network. Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact engaged patients bring to health care conference social media information flow and how they expand dissemination and distribution of tweets compared to other health care conference stakeholders such as physicians and researchers. Methods: From January 2014 through December 2016, 7,644,549 tweets were analyzed from 1672 health care conferences with at least 1000 tweets who had registered in Symplur's Health Care Hashtag Project from 2014 to 2016. The tweet content was analyzed to create a list of the top 100 influencers by mention from each conference, who were then subsequently categorized by stakeholder group. Multivariate linear regression models were created using stepwise function building to identify factors explaining variability as predictor variables for the model in which conference tweets were taken as the dependent variable. Results: Inclusion of engaged patients in health care conference social media was low compared to that of physicians and has not significantly changed over the last 3 years. When engaged patient voices are included in health care conferences, they greatly increase information flow as measured by total tweet volume (beta=301.6) compared to physicians (beta=137.3, P<.001), expand propagation of information tweeted during a conference as measured by social media impressions created (beta=1,700,000) compared to physicians (beta=270,000, P<.001), and deepen engagement in the tweet conversation as measured by replies to their tweets (beta=24.4) compared to physicians (beta=5.5, P<.001). Social network analysis of hubs and authorities revealed that patients had statistically significant higher hub scores (mean 8.26×10-4, SD 2.96×10-4) compared to other stakeholder groups' Twitter accounts (mean 7.19×10-4, SD 3.81×10-4; t273.84=4.302, P<.001). Conclusions: Although engaged patients are powerful accelerators of information flow, expanders of tweet propagation, and greatly deepen engagement in conversation of tweets on social media of health care conferences compared to physicians, they represent only 1.4% of the stakeholder mix of the top 100 influencers in the conversation. Health care conferences that fail to engage patients in their proceedings may risk limiting their engagement with the public, disseminating scientific information to a narrow community and slowing flow of information across social media channels. © Audun Utengen, Dara Rouholiman, Jamison G.

We also model Leetchi social media campaigns as a diffusion graph and extend our analysis with eight additional features: the order, the size, the number of connected components, the average in/out-degrees, the weighted average in/out-degrees and the density of the diffusion graph. Finally, we study the predictive power of all 15 features on the various levels of success of Leetchi projects using machine learning algorithms. We found that while traditional social media metrics allows predicting the reach of small funding (from 1C to 100C), social network features allow better distinguish projects with a high level of funding (from 100C to 1,000C). © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery."

It would be beneficial to understand the influence factors of reposting behavior and predict future reposting status, which could be practically applied in breaking news detection, marketing, social media researches and so on. Existing reposting analytics and prediction approaches mainly focus on factors related to the original information content and the social influence of the information publishers. However, online information diffuses by viral cascades instead of single-source broadcast in social network, which means some reposting behavior actually occurs in information propagators rather than the original publishers. In some social networks, users are allowed to comment when they repost, which represents their views and attitudes to the information they propagate. In this paper, we evaluate how emotional tendencies of information propagators influence future reposting. We first propose a modified sentiment analysis method and present emotional analysis on the user-generated content in online diffusion.

Companies are starting to recognize this potential especially for young target groups, and to hire these so-called 'influencers' as endorsers in social media; these individual influences sometimes even take the place of traditional celebrities in corporate advertising. The question arises whether there is a difference in perception between these two types of endorsers and if so, which moderators influence these perceptions. In this study we explore consumers' general perception of social media influencers compared to traditional celebrities. We conduct an online survey with 590 respondents who were asked to rate 14 influencers and traditional celebrities in pairwise comparisons regarding their similarity. We apply multidimensional scaling (MDS) and find substantial differences in perceptions between the two groups. Additionally, we apply property fitting with evaluations regarding six different characteristics determining endorser effectiveness. While in total traditional celebrities are evaluated more favorably, this difference diminishes for high levels of familiarity and even reverses for perceived trustworthiness and similarity to oneself. The results indicate that marketers should carefully distinguish between influencers and traditional celebrities for endorsements, as systematic differences in perceptions between the groups are likely to have an impact on endorser effectiveness. Further research is needed to investigate which moderators (e.g. advertising type, product category) influence the perception and subsequently the endorsement effectiveness of the two types of endorsers. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

This work-in-progress situates the valourization of digital fame in a socio-historical context, invoking critical theorist Leo Lowenthal's [20] ""mass idols"" framework. Examining the content of magazine biographies in the decades preceding World War II, Lowenthal identified a marked shift in cultural exemplars of success: from self-made entrepreneurs, politicians, and other ""Idols of Production""-to the stars of cinema and sports, ""Idols of Consumption."" As an extension of Lowenthal's analysis, we examine contemporary magazine biographies (in People and Time) and self-Authored social media bios (on Instagram and Twitter). Based on a preliminary analysis of the magazine content and social-media profiles-including the crucial shift to selfauthorship- we outline a new generation of what we call ""Idols of Promotion."" These digitally networked public figures, we argue, straddle the realms of production and consumption as they labor to create and project a distinctive self-brand. We identify three key tropes that shape narrativizations of idols in the social media age: (1) a spirit of self-enterprise that crosses industry boundaries; (2) a promise of meritocracy; and (3) a call to express oneself authentically. After examining these tropes, we conclude with an examination of their ideological function: such mediated hero-worship, we contend, indexes larger anxieties about the individualization of work amidst a precarious economy. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery."

This paper presents an effective, dynamic learning framework utilizing domain specific context information to design a novel classification model that can robustly identify malicious social media posts (e.g. enrollment propaganda for extremist groups) with expressions of extremism or criminal intent. Research towards automated identification of extreme online posts and their associated key suspects and threats faces numerous challenges, 1) Online data, particularly social media data, originated from numerous independent and heterogeneous sources are largely unstructured. 2) The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of criminal activity and extremism are constantly evolving. 3) There are limited ground truth data to support the development of effective classification technologies. In this paper, we present a human-machine collaborative, semi-supervised learning system that can efficiently and effectively identify malicious social media posts in presence of these challenges. Our system and framework develops an initial classifier from limited annotated data and in an interactive manner evolves dynamically into a sophisticated model using shortlisted relevant samples, identified via a graph-based optimization method, solvable by maximum flow algorithm. This same method also may be used to refine the classifier as TTPs evolve. Under this framework, the classifier performance converges faster using roughly 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer annotated samples, as compared to fully supervised solutions, resulting in a reasonably acceptable accuracy of nearly 80%. We validate our framework using a large collection of English and non-English flagged words extracted from three web-based forums and manually verified by multiple independent annotators. © 2017 IEEE."

We assessed volume, subject matter, influencers and content of urology related discussions on the Twitter platform using the recently proposed Urology Tag Ontology hashtag list. Methods We queried the Symplur Signals database for tweet activity during a 1-year period. We used the Urology Tag Ontology hashtag list, comprised of 45 disease related hashtags in 9 urological subspecialties, to assess activity (numbers of tweets, users and impressions), users (geolocation, influencers) and content (words, tweet enhancements) of urology related Twitter traffic. Results Twitter activity during the study period included 334,642 tweets by 104,166 users with 1,397,107,305 impressions. Tweet activity varied among urological subspecialties and was largely dominated by urological oncology topics driven by #ProstateCancer. Users came from 224 countries and from all continents around the globe. Health care organizations accounted for the largest proportion of influencers (44%), followed by other individuals (22%) and physicians (13%). The top words were “prevent” (used 20,955 times), “cancer” (19,610), “follow” (19,169), “men” (19,165) and “condom” (18,425). The median (range) number of shares was 2,200 (1,414-8,854) for the top 10 links, 2,123 (1,878-2,737) for the top 10 retweets and 207 (12-438) for the top 10 photos. Conclusions Twitter activity in the field of urology can be assessed using a standardized list of social media communication descriptors. The value of the Twitter communication platform is underscored by the large number of tweets and impressions in the urology space. © 2017 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc."

This study assessed social media data from Twitter to inform communication campaigns to promote HIV testing and reduce discrimination related to HIV/AIDS or towards key populations to the HIV epidemic, and its potential utility to evaluate such campaigns through HIV testing uptake. Tweets from Brazil were collected from January 2014 to March 2015 and filtered by four categories of keywords including discrimination, HIV prevention, HIV testing, and HIV campaigns. In total over 100,000 geo-located tweets were extracted and analyzed. A dynamic online dashboard updated daily allowed mapping trends, anomalies and influencers, and enabled its use for feedback to campaigns, including correcting misconceptions. These results encourage the use of social networking data for improved messaging in campaigns. Clinical HIV test data was collected monthly from the city of Curitiba and compared to the number of tweets mapped to the city showing a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.39). Results are limited due to the availability of the HIV testing data. The potential of social media as a proxy for HIV testing uptake needs further validation, which can only be done with higher frequency and higher spatial granularity of service delivery data, enabling comparisons with the social media data. Such timely information could empower early response immediate media messaging to support programmatic efforts, such as HIV prevention, testing, and treatment scale up. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Online marketing information diffusion has become the critical business model of online social networks. However, most of the current marketing studies on discovering potential influences do not appropriately support them to diffuse advertisements. Therefore, marketing information may be lost during the diffusion process and cannot be sent to potential customers successfully.

However, in many respects they have not yet achieved a definitive status within the field of fashion media, at least in terms of legitimization. This chapter addresses the following question: Is the golden era of fashion blogging over? It does so by comparing two national fields of fashion blogging, those of Italy and Spain. From a theoretical point of view bloggers are investigated as influentials and their work is considered as constitutive of the contemporary field of the fashion media, drawing on a Bourdieusian perspective. The arguments formulated in this chapter are based on quantitative and qualitative research carried out in Italy and Spain. Through desk analysis we investigated the features of the bloggers with the highest levels of visibility and their activity in the social media. A sample of 62 bloggers were interviewed with qualitative techniques to discuss the experience of common fashion bloggers. We conclude that blogs have gained a more institutionalized and normalized role in the field of fashion. Despite the presence of many aspirational bloggers, the field has left its 'naive' stage and has become more professionalized. Players such as companies and journalists, initially not always particularly enthusiastic about bloggers (especially in Italy), recognize and legitimize the role of bloggers as fashion influentials by employing them as marketing tools and contributors to magazines. The role of semi-professionalised bloggers is highlighted. Together with celebrities and common bloggers, they are part of the tripartite hierarchy that characterises the field of fashion blogging. © 2017.

To realize the potential of the new media platforms for public health, the function of opinion leaders is key. This study aims to identify and profile the most influential Twitter accounts in Saudi Arabia. Multiple measures, including: number of followers and four influence scores, were used to evaluate Twitter accounts. The data were then filtered and analysed using ratio and percentage calculations to identify the most influential users.

Study design This is a cross-sectional study in 370 Ghanaian adolescents (aged 11–18 years). Methods Questionnaires included disordered eating (EAT26), diet quality (FFQ), physical activity (IPAQ), well-being (KINDL) and media influence on appearance (SATAQ: pressure, internalisation and information). Ideal body size and body size dissatisfaction were assessed using the Stunkard figure rating scale. Body mass index (BMI), skinfolds and waist were measured. Linear regressions were adjusted for gender, age and parental education. Also, mediation was tested: ‘can perceived media influence play a role in the effects of actual body size on body size dissatisfaction?’. Results Body size dissatisfaction was associated with lower well-being and more media influence (pressure and internalisation) but not with physical activity, diet quality or disordered eating. An underweight body size ideal might worsen disordered eating but was not significantly related to the other predictors of interest. Only a partial mediation effect by media pressure was found: especially overweight adolescents felt media pressure, and this media pressure was associated with more body size dissatisfaction. Conclusions To prevent disordered eating and low well-being, health messages should include strategies that reduce body size dissatisfaction and increase body esteem by not focussing on the thin body ideal. Changing body size ideals in the media might be an appropriate way since media pressure was a mediator in the BMI-dissatisfaction relation. © 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health"

Yet, this commerce is sustained by an undercurrent of “filler” content wherein everyday routines of domestic life are shared with followers as a form of “calibrated amateurism.” Calibrated amateurism is a practice and aesthetic in which actors in an attention economy labor specifically over crafting contrived authenticity that portrays the raw aesthetic of an amateur, whether or not they really are amateurs by status or practice, by relying on the performance ecology of appropriate platforms, affordances, tools, cultural vernacular, and social capital. In this article, I consider the anatomy of calibrated amateurism, and how this practice relates to follower engagement and responses.

To more meaningfully understand the way parents decide what to share about young people and the way those decisions are being shaped, this article focuses on two overlapping areas: parental monitoring of babies and infants through the example of wearable technologies and parental mediation through the example of the public sharing practices of celebrity and influencer parents. The article begins by contextualizing these parental practices within the literature on surveillance, with particular attention to online surveillance and the increasing importance of affect. It then gives a brief overview of work on pregnancy mediation, monitoring on social media, and via pregnancy apps, which is the obvious precursor to examining parental sharing and monitoring practices regarding babies and infants. The examples of parental monitoring and parental mediation will then build on the idea of “intimate surveillance” which entails close and seemingly invasive monitoring by parents. Parental monitoring and mediation contribute to the normalization of intimate surveillance to the extent that surveillance is (re)situated as a necessary culture of care. The choice to not survey infants is thus positioned, worryingly, as a failure of parenting. © The Author(s) 2017."

This study addresses this gap and extends previous research by examining factors that influence consumers’ intentions to engage in s-commerce in four countries: Chile, Spain, South Africa and Australia. Specifically, this study develops and tests a model of consumers’ intentions to engage in s-commerce through brands’ Facebook pages incorporating personal variables (involvement in brands’ products and services, satisfaction with brands’ Facebook page), trust variables (message credibility of Facebook posts, trust in firms’ Facebook) and social variables (peer communication, social media dependency, online social interaction propensity) on predicting intentions to purchase products and services through brands’ Facebook pages if s-commerce was available to them. The findings show that the main drivers of s-commerce engagement are message credibility, trust in the brands’ Facebook, involvement, peer communication and online social interaction propensity, as influencers of consumer satisfaction with brands’ Facebook and social media dependency, which in turn drive intentions to engage in s-commerce. Contributing to theory and practice, these relationships are discussed for the four countries involved in the study. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd."

While previous research has studied the role of content or the role of influence in the spread of social media content separately, none has simultaneously examined both in an effort to assess the relative effects of each. Our modeling approach also accounts for a message's “fit” with users, based on the content of the message and the content of messages typically shared by users. As an empirical application, we examine how Twitter posts originating from top business schools are subsequently rebroadcasted (or retweeted) by other users. We employ an individual-level split hazard model that accounts for variation in rebroadcasting decisions related to (1) content, (2) the content-user fit and (3) the influence of other users. We find that the rebroadcasting a message depends not only on message content but also on the message's fit with a user. Our analysis also yields measures of influence and susceptibility to influence for each user, which can be used to identify influential social media users. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to evaluate different types of seeding strategies designed to increase the reach of social media messages. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) asserts widespread advertiser and publisher agreement regarding clear and prominent disclosure that native ads are paid content. The disclosures are important because they help prevent scrutiny about whether native advertising is misleading or deceptive, which could trigger policy intervention. However, by definition, native ads, including their disclosures, are designed to match the experience provided by other content. So, it is not clear (a) if consumers know native ads are sponsored content or (b) whether consumers care about the source of the content. Thus, the initial research questions are How are advertisers using native advertising? How are they disclosing their sponsorship of the content? To begin to address this gap in our understanding of native advertising, the article begins with a report of current native advertising formats and practices. It then reviews 122 examples of native ads from identified native advertising leaders over a 31-day period on October 2014. The report summarizes ad format (video, content, picture), industries that used native ads, the amount of engagement with the content during the 31-day period, and, perhaps most importantly, how the sponsorship was disclosed in each case. Most native ads that were recognized were in-stream ads that used words (vs. video or pictures). However, videos had higher levels of engagement (as measured by social media). Videos also seemed more likely to use celebrities and emotional appeals. Technology companies were the dominant users of native ads during the time period. Substantial variation existed in words used, shading, colors, capitalization, contrast between text and background color, font size, and timing/placement of disclosures. The manuscript contributes to the conceptualization of native advertising, provides an overview of disclosures currently used, and provides directions for next steps and future inquiry by marketers, policy makers, and policy influencers. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

Objective: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of designing, implementing, and evaluating a social media-enabled intervention for skin cancer prevention. Methods: A quasi-experimental feasibility study used social media (Twitter) to disseminate different message “frames” related to care in the sun and cancer prevention. Phase 1 utilized the Northern Ireland cancer charity's Twitter platform (May 1 to July 14, 2015). Following a 2-week “washout” period, Phase 2 commenced (August 1 to September 30, 2015) using a bespoke Twitter platform. Phase 2 also included a Thunderclap, whereby users allowed their social media accounts to automatically post a bespoke message on their behalf. Message frames were categorized into 5 broad categories: humor, shock or disgust, informative, personal stories, and opportunistic. Seed users with a notable following were contacted to be “influencers” in retweeting campaign content. A pre- and postintervention Web-based survey recorded skin cancer prevention knowledge and attitudes in Northern Ireland (population 1.8 million). Results: There were a total of 417,678 tweet impressions, 11,213 engagements, and 1211 retweets related to our campaign. Shocking messages generated the greatest impressions (shock, n=2369; informative, n=2258; humorous, n=1458; story, n=1680), whereas humorous messages generated greater engagement (humorous, n=148; shock, n=147; story, n=117; informative, n=100) and greater engagement rates compared with story tweets. Informative messages, resulted in the greatest number of shares (informative, n=17; humorous, n=10; shock, n=9; story, n=7). The study findings included improved knowledge of skin cancer severity in a pre- and postintervention Web-based survey, with greater awareness that skin cancer is the most common form of cancer (preintervention: 28.4% [95/335] vs postintervention: 39.3% [168/428] answered “True”) and that melanoma is most serious (49.1% [165/336] vs 55.5% [238/429]). The results also show improved attitudes toward ultraviolet (UV) exposure and skin cancer with a reduction in agreement that respondents “like to tan” (60.5% [202/334] vs 55.6% [238/428]). Conclusions: Social media-disseminated public health messages reached more than 23% of the Northern Ireland population. A Web-based survey suggested that the campaign might have contributed to improved knowledge and attitudes toward skin cancer among the target population. Findings suggested that shocking and humorous messages generated greatest impressions and engagement, but information-based messages were likely to be shared most. The extent of behavioral change as a result of the campaign remains to be explored, however, the change of attitudes and knowledge is promising. Social media is an inexpensive, effective method for delivering public health messages. However, existing and traditional process evaluation methods may not be suitable for social media. © Aisling Gough, Ruth F Hunter, Oluwaseun Ajao, Anna Jurek, Gary McKeown, Jun Hong, Eimear Barrett, Marbeth Ferguson, Gerry McElwee, Miriam McCarthy, Frank Kee.

The fitness industry has been heavily influenced by the growth of social media, generating billions of dollars in revenues worldwide, including sales of clothes, equipment, and services. Within this context, this research aims to investigate interactions at Instagram, identifying how followers consume content from the fitness profiles on this social network—focused on body cult and physical beauty—and how this content may influence them.

Both marketer and consumer messages might be spread or contested by other consumers or traditional media. In this complex social media-based buzz echo-verse (Hewett et al., 2016), it is ever more important for brands to be able to amplify their messages. In addition, platforms like Facebook have developed their display algorithm in a way that makes it increasingly difficult for marketers to organically appear in consumers’ social media feeds. At the same time, consumers are adopting ad blocking software at growing rates while also feeling ever more bombarded with information. This fuels a need for information filters and encourages the emergence of a traditional two-step flow of information (Katz, 1957), with opinion leaders pre-processing information and spreading messages to a wider, dedicated audience. These opinion leaders are trusted individuals who offer advice and exercise influence over the opinion of others.

Conversely, small and medium-sized businesses do not use this type of marketing strategy at all, even though with an appropriately defined system of rewards, the cooperation with social influencers does not necessarily have to be associated with high costs. The following paper explores the possibilities of partner affiliate programs and their use in the context of collaboration between social influencers and small businesses in e-commerce.

We distinguish between ‘marketing’ and ‘deliberative’ conceptualization of influencers and between metrics based on absolute figures and those from social network analytics; combining them leads to better understanding of user activity and connectivity measures in defining influential users. We add to the existing research by asking whether user activity necessarily leads to better connectivity and by what metrics in online ad hoc discussions, and try to compare the structure of influencers. To do this, we use comparable outbursts of discussions on inter-ethnic conflicts related to immigration. We collect Twitter data on violent conflicts between host and re-settled groups in Russia and Germany and look at top20 user lists by eight parameters of activity and connectivity to assess the structure of influencers in terms of pro/contra-migrant cleavages and institutional belonging. Our results show that, in both discussions, the number of users involved matters most for becoming an influencer by betweenness and pagerank centralities. Also, contrary to expectations, Russian top users all in all are, in general, more neutral, while Germans are more divided, but in both countries pro-migrant media oppose anti-migrant informal leaders. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG."

In the light of the emerging digital space for new forms of marketing, the traditional servicescape concept is critically examined. This paper aims to show why servicescape concepts and attitudes need to be adapted for digital media. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors explain how the traditional servicescape concept adds meaning to a service provider’s value-proposition by modifying customer expectations and customer experience. Second, recognising that the environment for service is no longer bound to a physical place, the authors discuss the implications of the epistemic shift involved. Findings: The authors’ examination shows that digital service space challenges traditional concepts about what constitutes a customer experience and derived value. The authors conceptually “zoom out” into a virtual service eco-system and show with exemplar examples why the servicescape in digital space is more socially embedded and necessarily more fluid in its time-space design. In the more advanced sites, interactions between various artificial bodies (avatars) are co-created by controlling off-line participant-actors; yet, these participant-actors remain strangers to each other at an off-line level. This is entirely a new and radical development of old times. Research limitations/implications: The research findings are based on scholarly research of the relevant literature, from practitioner reports, and evidence emerging from the examination of many digital web-sites. It has not been the authors’ intention to objectively represent current servicescape functionalities but more to indicate the major directions of change with exemplar examples. The future cannot be predicted, but their interpretive conclusions suggest major challenges in service marketing and management logic ahead. New forms of digital servicescape are still being created as technology and service imagination enables, so further research interest in virtual atmospherics can be expected. Practical implications: Social media platforms are enabling organisations to learn more about their customers and also to engage them more. In these changing times, bricks and mortar stores would be well advised to review their servicescape presence to allow and encourage engagement with the more involved consumers. And, by integrating their digital space into their physical place, bricks and mortar stores might take on more relationship oriented process-like characteristics, both in the digital space and in their physical places, with developments on one platform leading to possible service innovations on the other. Social implications: The digital era is changing consumer behaviour. Service managers need to take into account that many customers are already equally as engaged with digital-space social networks as they once were with bricks and mortar stores. The more time consumers as participant-actors spend in social networks, the decision on what and where to buy is decided by interactions with friends and other influencers. Originality/value: New forms of digital servicescape are being created as technology and service imagination enables. Further scholarly research interest in virtual atmospherics can be expected, impacting on the authors’ sense of place, and self-identity. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Prior research has examined certain aspects of this increasingly popular form of marketing communication, such as seeding strategies and their efficacy. Building on prior research, this study investigates the effects of SMCs that extend beyond the generation of WOM for a campaign’s focal product by considering how seeding can affect WOM spillover effects at the brand and category levels. The authors introduce a framework of SMC-related spillover effects, and empirically estimate these with a unique data set covering 390 SMCs for products from 192 different cosmetics brands. Multiple spillover effects are found, suggesting that while SMCs can be used primarily to stimulate WOM for a focal product, marketers must also account for brand- and category-level WOM spillover effects. Specifically, seeding increases conversations about that product among nonseed consumers, and, interestingly, decreases WOM about other products from the same brand and about competitors’ products in the same category as the focal product. These findings indicate that marketers can use SMCs to focus online WOM on a particular product by drawing consumers away from talking about other related, but off-topic, products. © 2017 INFORMS."

This study, based on social comparison theory, examined a psychological pathway from individual characteristics to selfie-editing behavior through social comparison. It was hypothesized that selfie-taking, public self-consciousness, social media use, and satisfaction with facial appearance would indirectly influence selfie-editing through social comparison of appearance (with friends or social media influencers/celebrities). A two-wave longitudinal online survey was conducted in South Korea among female smartphone users aged 20 to 39 (N = 1064 at Wave 1 and 782 at Wave 2). The results revealed that frequent selfie-taking, higher levels of public self-consciousness, and more use of social media at Wave 1 were associated with social comparison with friends at Wave 1, which increased selfie-editing behavior at Wave 2. However, those three independent variables did not have indirect effects on selfie-editing at Wave 2 through social comparison with influencers/celebrities. Also, satisfaction with facial appearance had neither direct nor indirect effect on selfie-editing at Wave 2. The findings suggest that individuals engage in social comparison and resulting selfie-editing not because of their dissatisfaction with appearance, but because of the desire for more ideal online self-presentation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper, we address questions on how the quality of each claim can be evaluated, and which factors should be considered to qualify the quality of the claims. To do this, we investigate the sources of low-quality claims an propose a new form of Quality of Claim (QoC) metrics. We categorize the Quality of Claim factors into two classes of Content Measure and Feedback Measure. The study is performed on Two datasets. The main dataset is the #IranDeal extracted from Twitter. To compare the quality metrics, a second dataset is crawled from the Fouresqure social network. The metrics follow the power law pattern and are modeled by a Zipfian distribution function.

Transplant programs are assuming an unprecedented role as facilitators of patients’ solicitation for donors, and nonprofits are promoting living kidney donation (LKD) in the community. New strategies to promote LKD incorporate “nonargumentative” forms of influence (i.e. approaches to shaping behavior that do not attempt to persuade through reason) such as appeals to emotion, messenger effects and social norms. These approaches have raised ethical concerns in other settings but have received little attention in the transplantation literature despite their increasing relevance. Previous work on using nonargumentative influence to shape patient behavior has highlighted implications for (1) the relationship between influencer and influenced and (2) patient autonomy.

Opinions and its related concepts such as sentiments and emotions are the subjects of study of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. The inception of mining opinions from online reviews coincide with the social media on the Web, e.g., reviews, discussion forums, blogs, micro blogs, Twitter, and social networks. Due to the large volume of opinionated data generated and available in digital forms, it become essential to mine such data and find opinions or sentiments in order to obtain the overall opinion on the topic i.e. products, politics, sports, education reforms, and so on. In this direction, it is proposed to design an algorithm which extracts opinion targets and opinion words using word alignment model for online reviews extracted from Twitter. An opinion target is defined as the topic about which users express their opinions. An opinion words are defined as the words that are used to express users' opinions. The aim of the project is to determine the thoughts of blog or review writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of online reviews using word alignment model. The key objective of this project is to design an algorithm that predict opinion words and opinion targets for analyzing the market status of a product by mining user reviews posted in social networking site namely the Twitter. For evaluation, Benchmark Customer Review Dataset and real tweets dataset pertaining to product reviews extracted using Twitter API. The results are measured in terms of Precision and Recall for accuracy of finding opinion words and targets in order to be an essential ingredient for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better accuracy in an efficient way. In addition, the ultimate outcome of this project to make choice of designing potential consumer oriented products e.g. Mobile, laptop, and so on. © 2016 IEEE."

Little is known about the amount or content of LCC messages users see or share on social media, a popular communication medium among youth and communities of colour. Methods Keyword rules were used to collect tweets related to LCCs from the Twitter Firehose posted in October 2014 and March-April 2015. Tweets were coded for promotional content, brand references, co-use with marijuana and subculture references (eg, rap/hip-hop, celebrity endorsements) and were classified as commercial and ‘organic’/non-commercial using a combination of machine learning methods, keyword algorithms and human coding. Metadata associated with each tweet were used to categorise users as influencers (1000 and more followers) and regular users (under 1000 followers). Results Keyword filters captured over 4 372 293 LCC tweets. Analyses revealed that 17% of account users posting about LCCs were influencers and 1% of accounts were overtly commercial. Influencers were more likely to mention LCC brands and post promotional messages. Approximately 83% of LCC tweets contained references to marijuana and 29% of tweets were memes. Tweets also contained references to rap/hip-hop lyrics and urban subculture. Conclusions Twitter is a major information-sharing and marketing platform for LCCs. Co-use of tobacco and marijuana is common and normalised on Twitter. The presence and broad reach of LCC messages on social media warrants urgent need for surveillance and serious attention from public health professionals and policymakers. Future tobacco use prevention initiatives should be adapted to ensure that they are inclusive of LCC use. © 2017, BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."

However, the recent popularity of practitioner publications indicates a timely moment to reassess the relationships among academic and nonacademic influencers in emerging communication design knowledge. In this paper, we introduce initial findings from the first phase of an ongoing research project that analyzes citation practices in communication design publications. First, we created a sample of over 1500 citations from 30 recent peer-reviewed journal articles that treat emerging communication design themes. Next, we coded authors or author teams from the 30 original articles and the 1500 cited publications to identify whether each author or author team was comprised of academic research faculty, nonacademics, or both. Based on this analysis, we show that academic citations comprise just over 60 percent of the total number in our sample. While this is a clear majority, non-academic citations do frequently influence the shape of peer-reviewed work on emerging communication design themes. Based on our findings, we argue for extending citation analysis to a larger sample of peer-reviewed journal articles and different publications types (i.e., proceedings, books, trade magazines, blogs, social media conversations) in order to test our findings. We furthermore call for social network analysis (SNA) that can reveal more complex interconnections among academic researchers and industry or independent thought leaders around topics such as user experience, content management and strategy, and project management. © 2016 ACM."

Yet, there is a dearth of research exploring the use of Twitter and electronic news outlets during significant worldly events such as the recent Ebola Virus scare. The purpose of this article is to investigate the use of Twitter and electronic news media outlets in communicating Ebola Virus information. A cross-sectional survey of Twitter data and Google News Trend data from 30 September till 29 October, 2014 was conducted. Between 30 September and 29 October, there were approximately 26 million tweets (25,925,152) that contained the word Ebola. The highest number of correlated activity for Twitter and electronic news outlets occurred on 16 October 2014. Other important peaks in Twitter data occurred on 1 October, 6 October, 8 October, and 12 October, 2014. The main influencers of the Twitter feeds were news media outlets. The study reveals a relationship between electronic news media publishing and Twitter activity around significant events such as Ebola.

Existing approaches of social influence analysis usually focus on how to develop effective algorithms to quantize users’ influence scores. They rarely consider a person’s expertise levels which are arguably important to influence measures. In this paper, we propose a computational approach to measuring the correlation between expertise and social media influence, and we take a new perspective to understand social media influence by incorporating expertise into influence analysis. We carefully constructed a large dataset of 13,684 Chinese celebrities from Sina Weibo (literally ”Sina microblogging”). We found that there is a strong correlation between expertise levels and social media influence scores. Our analysis gave a good explanation of the phenomenon of “top across-domain influencers”. In addition, different expertise levels showed influence variation patterns: e.g., (1) high-expertise celebrities have stronger influence on the “audience” in their expertise domains; (2) expertise seems to be more important than relevance and participation for social media influence; (3) the audiences of top expertise celebrities are more likely to forward tweets on topics outside the expertise domains from high-expertise celebrities. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

This article considers social knowledge production in the context of influencer marketing, a growing industry in which social media users are ranked according to measures of influence and compensated for promoting products online. Working from industry press, technical documentation and interviews with tool developers, marketing professionals, and social media users, it traces the sociotechnical shaping of influence, moving from computer scientists’ optimal solutions through technical constraints and business needs to the practices of marketing professionals and individual users. In doing so, it identifies two conceptions of influence. The first is connected to celebrities and practices of branding, while the second, more novel conception is associated with less prominent social media users who make themselves and their willingness to work visible to marketers through practices I describe as hustling. While social influence is conventionally conceptualized in relation to extensive, naturally occurring networks of individuals, in this context it is evaluated in relation to much simpler networks that bring together users who may never interact directly. In this context, users understand and manipulate their influence by positioning their followers (branding) and by explicitly affiliating themselves with non-human entities such as brands and topical hashtags (hustling). © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016."

We aimed to assess the activity, users and content of the online discussion, #KidneyStones, on Twitter. Methods: We investigated the Symplur Signals analytics tool for Twitter data distributed via the #KidneyStones hashtag over a one year period. Activity analysis reflected overall activity and tweet enhancements. We assessed users' geolocations and performed an influencer analysis. Content analysis included the most frequently used words, tweet sentiment and shares for top tweets. Results: 3,426 users generated over 10,333 tweets, which were frequently accompanied by links (49%), mentions (30%) and photos (13%). Users came from 106 countries across the globe and were most frequently from North America (63%) and Europe (16%). Individual and organisational healthcare professionals made up 56% of the influencers of the Twitter discussion on #KidneyStones. Besides the words 'kidney' (used 4,045 times) and 'stones' (3,335), 'pain' (1,233), 'urine' (1,158), and 'risk' (1,023) were the most frequently used words. 56% of tweets had a positive sentiment. The median (range) number of shares was 85 (62-587) for the top 10 links, 45.5 (17-94) for the top 10 photos, and 44 (22-95) for the top 10 retweets. Conclusion: The rapidly growing Twitter discussion on #KidneyStones engaged multiple stakeholders in the healthcare sector on a global scale and reached both professionals and laypeople. When used effectively and responsibly, the Twitter platform could improve prevention and medical care of kidney stone patients. © 2016 Salem et al.

The computational complexity of CI is O(N log N) when removing nodes one-by-one, made possible through an appropriate data structure to process CI. We introduce two Belief-Propagation (BP) variants of CI that consider global optimization via message-passing: CI propagation (CIP) and Collective-Immunization-Belief-Propagation algorithm (CIBP) based on optimal immunization. Both identify a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI and, remarkably, reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold obtained in Random Struct. Alg. 21, 397 (2002) for cubic random regular graphs, leaving little room for improvement for random graphs. However, the small augmented performance comes at the expense of increasing running time to O(N2), rendering BP prohibitive for modern-day big-data. For instance, for big-data social networks of 200 million users (e.g., Twitter users sending 500 million tweets/day), CI finds influencers in 2.5 hours on a single CPU, while all BP algorithms (CIP, CIBP and BDP) would take more than 3,000 years to accomplish the same task."

This shift toward public interest and participation in the development of Canadian information and digital policies has led to legislation, regulation, and policy outcomes that once seemed highly unlikely. This Article seeks to better understand the changing role of the public in Canadian information and digital policymaking by framing the developments as an ongoing policy development process featuring a series of closely linked changes and responses. The emergence of public participation on information and digital policy issues occurred across a spectrum of issues, yet the traits were strikingly similar: grassroots efforts reliant on social media and the Internet to capture media and public attention and focus it on consumer perspectives, minimal interest from government and regulators; and initial dismissal giving way to hostility from incumbent stakeholders. The Article identifies some of the reasons behind the shift, including the growing importance of information and digital policies, the impact of digital advocacy tools, and the shifting policy pyramid in which users have now largely leapfrogged corporate interests as policy influencers. While the shift does not mean the public interest wins on every issue, it does suggest an important change in influence with long-term ramifications for the development of information and digital policy in Canada that others may seek to emulate."

Conversations about this bullying—what it is, who is involved, and how to stop it—are taking place online. To fill a need for relevant, research-based materials on bullying, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration worked with Widmeyer Communications to investigate the scope of media conversations about bullying and discover new strategies for promoting appropriate public health messages about bullying to intended audiences. Key components of the methodology included: analyzing common search terms and aligning social media content with terms used in searches rather than technical language; identifying influencers in social media spheres, cultivating relationships with them, and sharing their positive, relevant content; examining which digital formats are most popular for sharing and creating content across platforms; tracking and reporting on a wide variety of metrics (such as click-through and engagement rates and reach, resonance, relevance, and Klout scores) to understand conversations around bullying; and looking at online conversations and engaging participants using applicable resources and calls to action. A key finding included a significant gap between search terms and online content and has led to recommendations and comprehensive ideas for improving the reach and resonance of StopBullying.gov content and communications. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Public Health Education."

The case started when Bob, the senior vice president of Thai ABC Airline, had to implement a new method of re-accommodating passengers in the case of canceled/delayed flights. The first incident was reported that the flight from Bangkok, Thailand (BKK) to Hong Kong (HKG) was expected to be delayed and seven passengers would definitely miss the original connecting flight from Hong Kong to Chicago, USA. Unfortunately, the next available flight to Chicago was almost fully booked and could accommodate only two more passengers. Thus, Bob and his team had to decide which two passengers should be on the next available flight and which others would have to stay overnight in Bangkok for the morning flight to Chicago on the next day. The following topics are discussed in or raised by the case: (1) Airline Industry and the incidence of passengers' dissatisfaction because of delayed/ canceled flights, (2) Business intelligence concept, (3) Customer acquisition and customer retention, (4) Social media and key influencers, and (5) Decision making based on different airline's strategic direction. © 2016 JITTC Palgrave Macmillan."

In democracies, it is becoming a mainstream contributor to policymaking and political participation. Meanwhile, the literature on non-democratic states largely views its role as an influencer of bottom-up collective action or as a top-down channel for service delivery. In such ""closed"" settings, the influence of social media on policymaking is not thoroughly addressed. Do participatory social media applications affect policymaking in non-democracies, beyond the two prevailing views? This paper explores this question by extracting lessons from the UAE's ""national brainstorming session""; a rare large-scale social media initiative for policy formulation in a region not much used to public engagement in governance. Based on an in-depth case study, the findings suggest that social media can influence policy formulation in non-democratic settings; highlighting an area for further research.

Social networks follow a power-law degree distribution of nodes, with a few hub nodes and a long tail of peripheral nodes. While there exist consolidated approaches supporting the identification and characterization of hub nodes, research on the analysis of the multi-layered distribution of peripheral nodes is limited. In social media, hub nodes represent social influencers. However, the literature provides evidence of the multi-layered structure of influence networks, emphasizing the distinction between influencers and influence. Information seems to spread following multi-hop paths across nodes in peripheral network layers. This paper proposes a visual approach to the graphical representation and exploration of peripheral layers and clusters by exploiting the theory of k-shell decomposition analysis. The core concept of the proposed approach is to partition the node set of a graph into pre-defined hub and peripheral nodes. Then, a power-law based modified force-directed method is applied to clearly display local multi-layered neighborhood clusters around hub nodes based on a characterization of the content of message that we refer to as content specificity. We put forward three hypotheses that allow the graphical identification of the peripheral nodes that are more likely to be influential and contribute to the spread of information. Hypotheses are tested on a large sample of tweets from the tourism domain. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

So some key questions are raised about B2B CMOs’ readiness to use social media, what this accomplishes and resulting effects upon the role of the CMO within an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: The research paper involves use of case studies drawn from IBM experience with social media. Findings: B2B CMOs are not ready to make use of social media. Even those who are actively engaging are expressing concern that they are pioneering and have not yet put in place a strategy that they are satisfied with. In addition, social media can be used for after-sales service, getting sales leads, engaging with key influencers, building the company’s reputation and enhancing the industry status of key individuals. B2B firms need to exploit the capabilities of processing massive amounts of data to get the most from social media. Originality/value: The paper brings insights to the challenges facing CMOs of B2B firms when using social media. It provides a better understanding of what should be the role of CMOs in the use of social media. The CMO must be the voice of the customer as well as the custodian of the values that enable effective use of social media. Effective collaboration within the boardroom is essential and if the CMO is not a board member, then the company should consider making that change. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The authors used an under-researched consumer-based authenticity approach. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt a practice theory approach to selfies as both objects and practices. The study combines depth-interviews with a review of the participants’ blogs and selfies. Findings: This research shows that bloggers use selfies as records of product trial, success and failure via specific sub-types. These selfies function as authenticating consumer acts, intertwined with key life narratives and as records of communal events, where bloggers identify as a community. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited to beauty bloggers. Further research on consumer authenticity could be extended to other product categories and other media channels. The widened definition of selfies proposed enables further research on self-representational practices in consumption contexts. Likewise, the practice theory approach could be extended to other online contexts. Practical implications: As social media and peer endorsement become ever more important to marketers, brands are seeking to leverage bloggers as brand ambassadors as well as the authenticity they convey.

IT researchers usually rely on subjective, survey-based methods to study envy. In the current paper, we investigated envy-related messages from Twitter through text analytics. We found that online envy was significantly associated with social media use patterns: users who ""favorite"" more and post less are more likely to express malicious envy while users who ""favorite"" less and post more are more likely to express benign envy. Moreover, users' influence moderates the degree of the two types of envy. When a user is a profound influencer, the user would be more likely to express a lower level of malicious envy, and would also be more likely to express a higher level of benign envy. The findings provide a number of theoretical contributions and practical implications."

This is a problem for businesses as user-generated content (UGC) often portrays brands negatively and, when mishandled, may turn into a crisis. This paper presents a framework for crisis management that incorporates insights from research on social media users’ behaviour. It looks beyond specific platforms and tools, to develop general principles for communicating with social media users. The framework’s relevance is illustrated via a widely publicised case of detrimental UGC. The paper proposes that, today, businesses need to identify relevant social media platforms, to monitor sentiment variances, and to go beyond simplistic metrics with content analysis. They also need to engage with online communities and the new influencers, and to respond quickly in a manner that is congruent with said social media platforms and their users’ expectations. The paper extends the theoretical understanding of crisis management to consider the role of social media as both a cause and a solution to those crises.

Our recent results and observations demonstrate that the shape and identity of this elite, especially those contributing original content, is difficult to predict. Information acquisition is often cited as an example of a public good. However, this emerging and powerful theory has yet to provably offer qualitative insights on how specialization of users into active and passive participants occurs. This paper bridges, for the first time, the theory of public goods and the analysis of diffusion in social media. We introduce a non-linear model of perishable public goods, leveraging new observations about sharing of media sources. The primary contribution of this work is to show that shelf time, which characterizes the rate at which content get renewed, is a critical factor in audience participation. Our model proves a fundamental dichotomy in information diffusion: While short-lived content has simple and predictable diffusion, long-lived content has complex specialization.

Data comprised 94 survey questionnaires and two focus groups; one comprised women in the breast screening population age group, the other was a younger group. A socio-ecological framework was used to identify key influencers and potential barriers for the implementation of a mammography DSN. The study identified issues related to three intersecting concepts which influenced women's behaviour: on-line conversations about health in general; on-line conversations about breast screening mammography and the culture of privacy which makes conversing about intimate health (either face to face or on-line) difficult. Also, the transient nature of the mammography episode (three yearly), could mean an on-line breast screening digital network is challenging to sustain. super-users' may be needed to continue on-line conversations.

The first approach adopted in this study was calculating the important descriptive statistics of MOOC-related tweets and examining the daily, weekly, and monthly trends of MOOC that appeared on Twitter. This information can enable MOOC practitioners to observe participants’ temporal activities on social media and ascertain the most effective time to post or analyze tweets. Secondly, we investigated how public sentiment toward MOOC learning can be assessed according to related tweets. Because the availability and popularity of opinion-rich social networking services are increasing for MOOC communities, our findings from the sentiment analysis of Twitter data can afford substantial insights into participant perceptions of MOOC learning. Third, we analyzed the positive and negative retweets related to MOOCs and identified the influencers of these retweets. Social network diagrams were also developed to reveal how sentimental messages about MOOCs on Twitter were disseminated from the top influencers with the highest number of positive/negative retweets about MOOCs. Analyzing the relationships among top retweet users is vital to MOOC practitioners because they can use this information to filter or recommend MOOC-related messages to the influencers.

We test these methods on data collected from a set of users on Twitter in 2011 and 2012. We find that the performance of the methods at predicting times of high activity depends strongly on the tradeoff between true and false positives, with no method dominating.

Localizing this optimal, that is, minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science. Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders, the problem remains unsolved. Here we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly connected nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. The present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous transition from a known phase. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Their practice of investing in retailer-hosted Word-of-Mouth (internal WOM) is supported by a positive feedback mechanism between internal WOM and retail sales. Internal WOM is a sales influencer: consumers can get informed about a product by a large volume of internal WOM. It is also a sales outcome: greater past sales lead to more WOM. Beyond internal WOM, consumers are shown to search widely for product information on third-party websites. Consequently, many firms also start to invest in content on third-party websites. However, little is known regarding the interplay between internal WOM and the contents of third-party websites, which have both been invested in by firms in recent years. In the context of the online software market, this study examines how WOM hosted by third-party websites (external WOM) and third-party free sampling influence the feedback mechanism between internal WOM and retail sales. Using data from Download.com and Amazon.com, we analyze the impact via a simultaneous equation model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. We find that external WOM and third-party free sampling moderate the sales-outcome role of internal WOM in different ways. Receiving external user reviews amplifies the impact of past sales on volume of internal WOM; whereas third-party free sampling weakens the impact of past sales on internal WOM. Moreover, this impact of external WOM and third-party free sampling on the sales-outcome role of internal WOM is much more significant than their impact on the sales-influencer role of internal WOM. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."

These studies model propagation of memes, i.e., pieces of infor- mation, between users in a social network similarly to the way diseases spread in human society. Naturally, many of these studies emphasize social exposure, i.e., the number of friends or acquaintances of a user that have exposed a meme to her, as the primary metric for understanding, predicting, and controlling information difiusion. Intuitively, one would expect a meme to spread in a so- cial network selectively, i.e., amongst the people who are interested in the meme. However, the importance of the alignment between the topicality of a meme and the topi- cal interests of the potential adopters and influencers in the network has been less explored in the literature. In this pa- per, we quantify the impact of the topical alignment between memes and users on their adoption. Our analysis, using em- pirical data about two different types of memes, i.e., hash- tags and URLs spreading through the Twitter social media platform, finds that topical alignment between memes and users is as crucial as the social exposure in understanding and predicting meme adoptions. Our results emphasize the need to look beyond social network-based viral propagation models and develop microscopic models of information dif- fusion that account for interests of users and topicality of information."

The increased presence of online consumers has led to a need to self-present, and to develop oneself as a personal brand because online social media require members to create a personal profile. Online users developed their image(s), created and shared stories, and gradually built a presence in the online world. According to the media and communication literature society has reached a point at which consumers are obsessed with celebrity’s lives as never before. Online social media has fuelled the exposure of consumers to celebrities at a level previously unheard of. It is suggested that intense celebrity exposure, along with the increased usage of such sites by the general population results in an entirely new phenomenon that for the purpose of this study is labeled Online Self Branding. To explore the constructs explaining the relationship between celebrity consumption and online consumer behavior, a set of qualitative studies was designed and implemented. Data analysis suggests that there is a wide range of reasons why consumers construct online profiles. On one extreme are obsessed and addicted consumers who consider this a must, whilst at the opposite extreme are consumers who believe this is a good communication tool for networking and business. Respondents exhibited substantial awareness of the breadth of communication possibilities offered by online social media sites. They seem to understand the power of self-presentation and how online social sites can help build their identities and communicate to their networks their preferred image. The image may be similar or dissimilar to their offline persona, or they may develop more than one online persona. Interestingly, some respondents differentiate their behavior between different social networks, suggesting they re-brand themselves. They seek for influencers, for somebody they can relate to, and amongst the influencers are the celebrities Additionally, data suggest that there is a level of connection between consumers and their celebrity of choice that goes beyond the consumption of celebrities as products. Consumers don’t stop at enjoying the celebrity at what he or she does best, but attempt to emulate the celebrity’s lifestyle. An extension of these relationships is for the consumers to consider being a celebrity within their circle of friends. Respondents enjoy influencing their own social network. The general consensus is that the number of friends is proportional to one’s influence, such that the more online friends they have, the more they can potentially influence others. They also equate the number of friends as a potential asset. The preliminary results of these studies suggest there is a link between the consumption of celebrities and consumers’ behavior online. Celebrity consumption has an effect on celebrity consumers behavior in the online world, by not only affecting their consumption patterns, but also by creating a value system that affects the celebrity consumers’ daily lives, by emulating celebrities and brand themselves as celebrities in their online social network. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science."

The academic literature has seen a rise in interest in the micro-blogging platform. For instance, Adi and Moloney (2012) assess the strategic uses of Twitter by protest groups, Adi, Erickson and Lilleker (2014) reflect on the networks and use pattern of the same platform by politicians, namely UK Labor party representatives in the House of Lords while Adi and Grigore (2015) analyze the strategic uses of social media by corporations. Bajpai and Jaiswal (2011) on the other hand propose a framework for analyzing collective action events on Twitter and so do the creators behind visual analysis platforms like NodeXL, Gephi, Linkurious and Socioviz. Public Relations research too has provided several reflections and analyses of Twitter. Verhoeven et al (2012) and Sweetsner and Kelleher discuss how practitioners use social media; Lovejoy, Waters and Saxton evaluate how NGO are engaging stakeholders though the new medium, while Saffer, Sommerfeldt and Taylor (2013) suggest that Twitter interactivity influences the quality of organization-public relationships. With questions about the professionalization of Public Relations as well as about the portrayals and perceptions of the profession continuing to intrigue researchers, it is surprising that only Xifra and Grau (2010) looked into the type of information shared in tweets about public relations. Using the Twitter data collection and analysis option from Socioviz this paper provides an exploratory account of the #publicrelations on Twitter. Using the visualizations provided by the platform and automated data analysis to gain insight into over 10,000 tweets published during June 15-24 and July 15-24, this paper qualitatively assesses the emerging themes about public relations focusing on association of hashtags and type of messages shared and identifies the most active and most influential users within the issue topic. The paper reveals that the #publicrelations is often associated with #jobs or is hijacked and associated with tags such as #gossip or #entertainment. The paper also shows that conversation in the #publicrelations issue network is limited and that the hashtag only partially includes content relevant to the practice. In doing so the paper raises important questions about the nature of dialogue and symmetry on social media and their assessment and suggests that further research should explore twitter chats as well as continue to apply similar data collection methods as used for the study. © 2015, National University of Political Studies and Public Administration.

It builds on the theories of social capital and social cognition to develop a model for examining the influence of different dimensions of social capital (i.e., structural, relational, and cognitive) on students' knowledge sharing via social media. Based on a survey of students at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), we find that the critical influencers of knowledge sharing are identification and outcome expectations.

Existing works on top-k influential nodes discovery find influential users at single time point only and do not capture whether the users are consistently influential over a period of time. Finding top-k consistent influencers has many interesting applications, such as targeted marketing, recommendation, experts finding, and stock market. Identifying top-k consistent influencers is a challenging task. First, we need to dynamically compute the total influence of each user at each time point from an action log. However, to find the consistent top-scorers, we need to sort and rank them at each time point. This is computationally expensive and not scalable. In this paper, we define the consistency of a node based on its influence and volatility over time. With the help of grid index, we develop an efficient algorithm called TCI to obtain the top-k consistent influencers given a time period. We conduct extensive experiments on three real world datasets to evaluate the proposed methods. We also demonstrate the usefulness of top-k consistent influencers in identifying information sources and finding experts.

To increase the probability of success, these messages are typically tailored to affect a defined group, a target audience. Target audience analysis (TAA) is a process of finding suitable target audiences for influence operations. There are multiple ways of completing the task, ranging from fast and intuitive to complex multi-staged processes. These processes use the information available at the moment of making presumptions about the effectiveness of competing approaches in order to choose those with best end results. The internet presents a challenge to this type of sequential, linear process by resisting to stop changing while the process is being executed or to conform to direct causalities. The internet is more like a rhizome, as presented by Deleuze and Guattari in the Thousand Plateaus. Within the context of rhizome, we also suggest defining the target audience(TA) - not as a pre-defined, but as a time-sensitive group, temporarily advantageous to the intended influence effort. This temporal advantage may be due to different causes, such as the topic being promoted by a popular media figure (a blogger for instance) or real-life incidents capable of shifting opinions towards the intended end of opinion charts. Instead of carrying outa linear, effectively one-time process of TAA we argue that it is possible to use the powers granted by the digital domain to constantly be on the lookout for, not perhaps the rhizome itself, but the 'fruiting bodies' it produces. Whenever the rhizome produces a favourable TA, it can be found by software, analysed and either catalysed into growing or suffocated with a spiral of silence."

Online social capital is an individual's network of social connections, a network that enables and encourages social cooperation. The Spiral of Silence theory suggests that an opinion can become dominant if those who perceive their opinion to be in the minority do not speak up because society threatens them with isolation. A study of 550 individuals explored their willingness to speak up on an issue, and assessed whether they thought they held a majority or a minority opinion. This study compared both their bonding social capital (via homogeneous networks) and bridging social capital (via heterogeneous networks) to their willingness to speak up and their perceptions of whether others held their opinions. Regression analyses shows that bridging social capital is a key influencer in people's willingness to speak up in social media and other online venues. © 2015, First Monday. Kim Bartel Sheehan."

Experiments on hundreds of thousands of videos and millions of tweets show that Twitter-derived features alone can predict whether a video will be in the top 5% for EARLY popularity with 0.7 Precision@100. Furthermore, our results reveal that while individual influence is indeed important for predicting how Twitter drives YouTube views, it is a diversity of interest from the most active to the least active Twitter users mentioning a video (measured by the variation in their total activity) that is most informative for both Jump and Early prediction. In summary, by going beyond features that quantify individual influence and additionally leveraging collective features of activity variation, we are able to obtain an effective cross-network predictor of Twitter-driven YouTube views."

A few articles sought to describe participant behavior using Twitter at scientific conferences. Family physicians are known as active participants in social media, but their behavior and practices at conferences have not been methodically described.METHODS: We recorded all public tweets at the 2013 Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM) Annual Spring Conference bearing the hashtag #STFM13, using commercially available services. We created a transcript of all tweets for the 5 days of the conference and 3 days before and after. We looked at the total number of tweets, number of original tweets and re-tweets, active users, most prolific users, and impressions. We categorized the content based on (1) Session related, (2) Social, (3) Logistics, (4) Ads, and (5) Other. We compared major metrics (but not content) to the 2012 STFM Annual Spring Conference.RESULTS: There were a total of 1,818 tweets from 181 user accounts: 13% of the conference registrants. The top tweeter accounted for over 15% of the total tweets, and the top 10 accounted for over 50% of the total volume. Most original tweets (69.7%) were related to session content. Social content came in second (14.2%), followed by other, logistics, and advertisement (7.6%, 6.9%, 1.6%).CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary analysis provides an initial snapshot of twitter activity at a family medicine conference. It may suggest avenues for further inquiry: trend identification, ""influencer"" identification, and qualitative analysis. Interdisciplinary research should focus on evaluation methods that can assess the quality, value, and impact of tweeting."

While there exist consolidated approaches supporting the identification and characterization of hub nodes, research on the analysis of the multi-layered distribution of peripheral nodes is limited. In social media, hub nodes represent social influencers. However, the literature provides evidence of the multi-layered structure of influence networks, emphasizing the distinction between influencers and influence. The latter seems to spread following multi-hop paths across nodes in peripheral network layers. This paper proposes a visual approach to the graphical representation and exploration of pe- ripheral layers and clusters to exploit underlying concept of k-shell decomposition analysis. The core concept of our approach is to partition the node set of a graph into hub and peripheral nodes. Then, a power-law based modified force-directed method is applied to clearly display local multi-layered neighbourhood clusters around hub nodes. Our approach is tested on a large sample of tweets from the tourism domain. Empirical results indicate that peripheral nodes have a greater probability of being retweeted and, thus, play a critical role in determining the influence of content. Our visualization technique helps us highlight peripheral nodes and, thus, seems an interesting tool to the visual analysis of social influence."

An inherent limitation of such methods is that they can only detect influential users after such users show observable signals of influence. However, in many real world applications including a countercampaign, an organization needs a way to detect influencers early, so that they can take appropriate measure before it is too late to intervene. In this work, we present a method to detect such would-be influencers from their prior word usage in social media. We compute psycholinguistic category scores from word usage, and investigate how people with different scores exhibited different influence behaviors on Twitter. We also found psycholinguistic categories that show significant correlations with such behaviors, and built predictive models of influence from such category based features. Our experiments using a real world dataset validates that such predictions can be done with reasonable accuracy.

For that end, we devise a novel behavioral model of authors and readers, where authors try to influence readers by generating ""attractive"" content, which is both relevant and unique, and readers can become authors themselves by further citing or referencing content made by other authors. The model is realized by means of a content-based citation graph, where nodes represent authors with their generated content and edges represent reader-to-author citations. To find the top influencers for a given topic, we first profile the content of authors (nodes) and citations (edges) and derive topic-based similarity scores to the topic, which further model the unique and relevant topic interests of users. We then present three different extensions of the Topic-Sensitive PageRank algorithm that exploit the similarity scores to find topic-based influencers. We evaluate our solution on a large real-world dataset that was gathered from Twitter by measuring information diffusion in social networks. We show that, overall, our methods outperform several state-of-the-art methods. This work further serves as an evidence that the topic uniqueness aspect in user interests within social media should be considered for the influencers detection task; this is in comparison to previous works that have solely focused on detecting topic-based influencers using the combination of link structure and topic-relevance. © 2014 ACM."

Categorization of Twitter profiles of users found within the top 20 most influential lists, according to each metric of influence, made up the qualitative portion of analysis. The authors find that measures of centrality-indegree and eigenvector centrality-identify the traditional political elite (media outlets, journalists, politicians) as influential, whereas measures considering the quality of messages and interactions provide a different group of influencers, including political commentators and bloggers.

Social influence mining in social networks is therefore of critical importance in real-world applications such as friend suggestion and photo recommendation. Social media is inherently multimodal, including rich types of user contributed content and social link information. Most of the existing research suffers from two limitations: 1) only utilizing the textual information, and/or 2) only analyzing the generic influence but ignoring the more important topic-level influence. To address these limitations, in this paper we develop a novel Topic-Sensitive Influencer Mining (TSIM) framework in interest-based social media networks. Specifically, we take Flickr as the study platform. People in Flickr interact with each other through images. TSIM aims to find topical influential users and images. The influence estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. In the hypergraph, the vertices represent users and images, and the hyperedges are utilized to capture multi-type relations including visual-textual content relations among images, and social links between users and images. Algorithmwise, TSIM first learns the topic distribution by leveraging user-contributed images, and then infers the influence strength under different topics for each node in the hypergraph. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of more than 50 K images and 70 K comment/favorite links from Flickr have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. In addition, we also report promising results of friend suggestion and photo recommendation via TSIM on the same dataset. © 2014 IEEE."

Social media websites, representing various forms of UGC, are also specifically gaining considerable attention from tourists and potential tourists. Now, tourists have the option of seeking information from ""new media,"" such as the Internet and social media, as well as traditional media, including films, television, books, magazines, and newspapers. Whereas both new and traditional media will play key roles in influencing the destination choices of tourists, research must also consider the influence of social groups that then translates through word of mouth (WOM). The youth and student travel market is a valuable segment of the overall tourism market, although it is often dismissed or ignored by tourism operators as youth tourists are wrongly perceived as having little financial value. This is, perhaps, because youth and student tourists are generally perceived as having a low income, and thus little disposable income to contribute towards travel. This research addresses this lack of attention by examining and exploring the international destination choice influencers of students with regard to peer and social pressure, traditional WOM, online social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, and other UGC websites. The research used a qualitative, focus group study strategy. The results found that all 24 university student participants indicated some level of apprehension about the reliability of information found on the Internet and social media in particular, and there were also varying degrees of reluctance to utilize social media as a credible destination information source. This contradicts previous research suggesting young people such as university students do not generally show concern about the credibility of information found in social media. © 2013 Cognizant Comm.

According to temporal data justification, we propose a multimodal probabilistic model, considering both users' textual annotation and uploaded visual images. This model is capable of simultaneously extracting user topic distributions and topic-sensitive influence strengths. By identifying the topic-sensitive influencer, we are able to conduct applications, like collective search and collaborative recommendation. A risk minimization-based general framework for personalized image search is further presented, where the image search task is transferred to measure the distance of image and personalized query language models. The framework considers the noisy tag issue and enables easy incorporation of social influence. We have conducted experiments on a large-scale Flickr dataset.

Corporations have seen how consumers can share their experiences with products and services. Smart companies find ways to leverage these conversations to engage current and potential customers and other stakeholders. Design/methodological approach - Our approach is theoretical, based on an examination of how the communication channel of social media can be used as a strategic tool throughout the organization, going well beyond marketing. Findings - This chapter looks at four advantages of social media. Social media provides a mechanism for firms to not just find customers, but also allow customers to find firms. Social media can engage customers, industry influencers, and thought pundits in cost-effective ways that benefit both the firm and stakeholders. The largest contribution of social media is the information from big data on customer needs and wants as well as on the processes underlying consumer decisions. The greatest opportunity lies in how a firm converts data into actionable intelligence in real time. Practical applications - We discuss how the words, social and media, need to be de-coupled: The concept of social can be practically applied very effectively to areas of strategy and internal learning, and product development. Taking advantage of the opportunities presented by social media requires a social enterprise to be effective. Originality - This chapter presents an original theoretical framework of social media that can be used by a company to examine the social aspects and implications of every element in the value chain.

It investigates whether traditional segmentation approaches are still relevant in this new socio-technical environment and identifies emerging practices. The study found that social media are particularly promising in terms of targeting influencers, enabling the cost-effective delivery of personalised messages and engaging with numerous customer segments in a differentiated way. However, some problems previously identified in the segmentation literature still occur in the social media environment, such as the technical challenge of integrating databases, the preference for pragmatic rather than complex solutions and the lack of relevant analytical skills.

In this paper, we expand this line of research by exploring the internal processes that organizations put in place to support their social media initiatives. Using a mixed methods approach that combines data mining and content analysis techniques, we examine the adoption of social media across multiple industries. To avoid limiting our sample to a specific social media technology, we analysed 20,285 web-based job postings related to social media job, and identified around 9000 companies from those job postings representing all 20 main industries in the USA. Results provide a broader view of social media diffusion across industries, highlight new organizational uses of social media (e.g., social media listening, using social media to engage with industry and media influencers) and provide deeper insight into the internal processes employed by organizations to support their social media initiatives (e.g., develop social media strategies, managing social media platform, developing social media metrics)."

It contrasts ""stickiness""-aggregating attention in centralized places-with ""spreadability""-dispersing content widely through both formal and informal networks,some approved, many unauthorized. Stickiness has been the measure of success in the broadcast era (and has been carried over to the online world), but ""spreadability"" describes the ways content travels through social media. Following up on the hugely influential Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, this book challenges some of the prevailing metaphors and frameworks used to describe contemporary media, from biological metaphors like ""memes"" and ""viral"" to the concept of ""Web 2.0"" and the popular notion of ""influencers."" Spreadable Media examines the nature of audience engagement,the environment of participation, the way appraisal creates value,and the transnational flows at the heart of these phenomena. It delineates the elements that make content more spreadable and highlights emerging media business models built for a world of participatory circulation. The book also explores the internal tensions companies face as they adapt to the new communication reality and argues for the need to shift from ""hearing"" to ""listening"" in corporate culture. Drawing on examples from film, music, games, comics, television,transmedia storytelling, advertising, and public relations industries,among others-from both the U.S. and around the world-the authors illustrate the contours of our current media environment. They highlight the vexing questions content creators must tackle and the responsibilities we all face as citizens in a world where many of us regularly circulate media content. Written for any and all of us who actively create and share media content, Spreadable Media provides a clear understanding of how people are spreading ideas and the implications these activities have for business, politics, and everyday life. © 2013 by New York University.

In this paper, we investigate the measures of scholars' influence in academic social media platforms, taking both academic and social impact into account. A real-life dataset collected from Mendeley is used to apply different influence metrics. We first assess the academic influence of scholars based on the scientific impact of their publications using three different measures. Then we investigate their social influence using network centrality metrics. The experiments show that top influencers with high academic impact tend to be senior scholars with many coauthors. Furthermore, academic influence and social influence measures do not strongly correlate with each other, and thus scholars with high academic impact are not necessarily influential from a social point of view. Adding the social dimension could enhance the traditional impact metrics that only take academic influence into account. Copyright 2013 ACM."

In this paper, we aim to investigate how the location and heterogeneity of influencers in social networks can improve convergence. We propose a voter model with dynamic self-conviction and heterogeneous individual influence which is related to the underlying network topology. An agent may keep its current opinion according to personal conviction, or otherwise, it may preferentially choose the opinion of the neighbor that has a great influence. Individual conviction evolves during the dynamic process, and can be strengthened by social recognition. Simulations indicate our model has three nontrivial results. First, the conservation of average magnetization in the voter model is broken under the effect of individual conviction and influence, and the system evolves to an ordered state in which one opinion is dominant, but total consensus is prevented by extremists. Furthermore, individual influence has a subtle action on opinion evolution. The heterogeneity of individual influence accelerates the relaxation process, but, with the action of dynamic conviction, more heterogeneous influence does not mean the average magnetization will be more ordered. In addition, when competing with agents' conviction, more heterogeneous individual influence plays a more significant role in agents' decisions. These results are helpful for understanding some aspects of collective phenomena that occur on online social media. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Product promotion through social media provides the advantages of viral marketing and electronic word of mouth at a very reasonable cost. This instrument need careful implementation because any negative feedback through network can spoil the brand image and in the longer run the profitability of the company. This study examines the empirical support for social networking sites as influencer to various stages of consumer purchase decision viz improvement in product knowledge, change in attitude towards the product, impulse to purchase the product and post purchase customer relationship. Regression analysis was performed to assess the dependency relationship between various stages of consumer purchase decision (dependent variables) and various forms of communication over social networking sites (independent variables).

This study maps the landscape surrounding social media traffic about nanotechnology. Specifically, we use computational linguistic software to analyze a census of all English-language nanotechnology-related tweets expressing opinions posted on Twitter between September 1, 2010 and August 31, 2011. Results show that 55 % of tweets expressed certainty and 45 % expressed uncertainty. Twenty-seven percent of tweets expressed optimistic outlooks, 32 % expressed neutral outlooks and 41 % expressed pessimistic outlooks. Tweets were mapped by U.S. state, and our data show that tweets are more likely to originate from states with a federally funded National Nanotechnology Initiative center or network. The trend toward certainty in opinion coupled with the distinct geographic origins of much of the social media traffic on Twitter for nanotechnology-related opinion has significant implications for understanding how key online influencers are debating and positioning the issue of nanotechnology for lay and policy audiences. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

While existing research focuses on global influence modeling and applies to text-based networks, this work investigates the problem of topic-sensitive influence modeling in the multimedia domain. We propose a multi-modal probabilistic model, considering both users' textual annotation and uploaded visual image. This model is capable of simultaneously extracting user topic distributions and topic-sensitive influence strengths. By identifying the topic-sensitive influencer, we are able to conduct applications like collective search and collaborative recommendation. A risk minimization-based general framework for personalized image search is further presented, where the image search task is transferred to measure the distance of image and personalized query language models. The framework considers the noisy tag issue and enables easy incorporation of social influence. We have conducted experiments on a large-scale Flickr dataset.

Instead, they leverage ""friend of a friend"" relationships where existing members or sympathizers bridge the gap between potential recruits and terrorist leadership or influencer s. As anti-Western propaganda flows through these social networks, homegrown terrorists and lone wolf terrorists have been inspired to commit acts of terrorism. These terrorist social networks in social media can be uncovered and mapped providing an opportunity to apply social network analysis algorithms. Leveraging these algorithms, the main influencers can be identified along with the individuals bridging the gap between the sympathizers and influencers."

Their interactions inside these on-line communities follow several, interesting patterns. For example, they differ in the level of influence they exert to the rest of the group: some community members are actively involved, affecting a large part of the community with their actions, while the majority comprises plain participants (e.g., information consumers). Identifying users of the former category lies on the focus of interest of many recent works, as they can be employed in a variety of applications, like targeted marketing. In this paper, we build on previous research that examined influencers in the context of a popular Social Media web site, namely Twitter. Unlike existing works that consider its user base as a whole, we focus on communities that are created on-the-fly by people that post messages about a particular topic (i.e., topic communities). We examine a large and representative sample of real-world communities and evaluate to which extent their influential users determine the aggregate behavior of the entire community. To this end, we consider a practical use case: we check whether the community's overall sentiment stems from the aggregate sentiment of this core group. We also examine the dynamics of groups of influencers by assessing the strength of the ties between them. In addition, we identify patterns in the content produced by influencers and the relation between influencers of different communities. Our experiments lead to interesting conclusions that highlight many aspects of in-fluencers' activity inside topic communities; thus, they form the basis for intelligent, data mining techniques that can automatically discover influencers in the context of a community.

It is one of the most active research areas in natural language processing and is also widely studied in data mining, Web mining, and text mining. In fact, this research has spread outside of computer science to the management sciences and social sciences due to its importance to business and society as a whole. The growing importance of sentiment analysis coincides with the growth of social media such as reviews, forum discussions, blogs, micro-blogs, Twitter, and social networks. For the first time in human history, we now have a huge volume of opinionated data recorded in digital form for analysis. Sentiment analysis systems are being applied in almost every business and social domain because opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors. Our beliefs and perceptions of reality, and the choices we make, are largely conditioned on how others see and evaluate the world. For this reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out the opinions of others. This is true not only for individuals but also for organizations. This book is a comprehensive introductory and survey text. It covers all important topics and the latest developments in the field with over 400 references.

If there's anything the recession of 2009 taught us, it was the importance of investing in our customers, but when was this any different? So says Joseph Jaffe, bestselling author of Life After the 30-Second Spot and Join the Conversation, and a leading expert and thought leader on new media and social media. In most businesses, it costs roughly five-to-ten times more to acquire a new customer than it does to retain an existing one, and yet companies continue to disproportionately spend their budgets into the ""wrong"" end of the funnel - the mass media or awareness side. What we haven't paid enough attention to is the ""right"" end of the funnel-the word-of-mouth component that essentially acts as a multiplier for future business. The economic impact of an active, engaged and loyal customer is tremendous. And the same is true of the opposite scenario, namely the impact of angry customers and negative word-of-mouth or referrals. It is this thinking that Jaffe has channeled to challenge marketers to ""flip the funnel"" once and for all. With a renewed focus and energy on customer experience, it is possible to grow your sales, while decreasing your budget - in other words, getting more from less. Engaging a few customers to spread the word to many. Using this new ""flipped funnel"" model, together with a set of new rules of customer service and a revolutionary customer referral and activation process, you'll learn how to transform your existing customers into your best salespeople. In addition, Jaffe will explain how to best introduce and combine both digital and social media tools to boost your loyalty arsenal, deploy ""influencer marketing"" and implement word-of-mouth strategies that inspire your loyal, opinionated, and most vocal customers to become credible, persuasive, and influential endorsers of your products and services.

However an analysis of the demography of this user base indicates an ever growing diversity. Currently only 38.8% of internet users originate from the countries such as Europe, America and Australia whereas 61.2% internet users come from the Africa, Asia and Middle East1. Moreover, these figures are changing even farther in favour of Africa, Asia and Middle East countries since their current internet penetration levels are relatively low e.g. the penetration of the internet in China/Asia is only at 21%, and Africa is only 10%. It is clear that the diversity of the user base of the web is growing rapidly. Moreover research is showing that each individual uses the WWW in different ways that suit their own personal needs, preferences. However, it is also clear that these differences extends far beyond just the appropriateness of content selection, and encompasses many dimensions e.g. tasks &amp; activities, cultural preferences, language and social interaction etc. From a language diversity perspective, this growing diversity of internet users is increasingly apparent with English only accounting for 27% of all languages on the Internet in 2010. Other evidence of user diversity is demonstrated in social networking sites such as Facebook where in 2007 it supported 50M users in only one language (English) whilst by 2010 it had grown to 600M users and supported 77 different languages. By 2010 55% (approximately 13.75 Billion) tweets on Twitter were non-English. The expansion of the internet is not just in user number but has also resulted in vast quantities and great diversity of WWW accessible content where user generated content has for some time exceeded traditional web hosted content. In 2011, mobile access to the Internet and WWW has exceeded that accessed from desktop computers. Increasingly digital content on the internet is reaching users, not just through traditional web queries but via collaborative social networks and mediated personalisation filters, which check for affinity, freshness2 and other complex selection factors. Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web research is examining the personalised delivery and exploration of adaptive content. However, content personalisation has traditionally been focused on closed-corpus content, with less research being conducted on open corpus content. From a commercial perspective, information portals and rec-ommender systems have been more focused on adaptive content identification/retrieval rather than adaptive content composition. It is well recognised that a key influencer on the WWW's evolution will be the end-users themselves and not just the major commercial internet players and technical communities3. In fact social networking/social media is the fastest growing sector of the WWW and is facilitating the rapid formation of communities of extremely diverse users. The evolving WWW must be able to break the barriers of language, it must empower users to easily assimilate and reuse content, and it must connect users with real, shared interests in an even more meaningful way. © 2011 ACM."

This paper aims to reveal his conclusion is that we have a lot of new lessons to learn about social media. Design/methodology/approach: The author reports on eight conference presentations by leading marketers from Facebook, Twitter, PepsiCo, Sony, VISA and others. Findings: The theme of scalable real time analysis of metrics and messages, and strategic implementation of user-friendly and effective communication based on that endless river of data, ran through most of the comments made at the conference. Practical implications: The social network business proposition can be driven by either of two approaches, hi-tech artificial intelligence or the personal-folksy local experience, each enriching the communication between marketer and consumer. Identify the conversation customers want to have and to support their interests so that companies can create an ad that is, more or less, a ""content experience.""

But Twitter is not so much a social network where the exchange of personal information is facilitated - in fact, recent surveys state that it's not very social at all with a large amount of inactive accounts and a low motivation of engaging in dialogues [1]. Twitter has rather evolved into a pool of constantly updating information streams consisting of links, short status updates, and eyewitness news. Among the millions of users, a small percentage is what is called the group of influencers or alpha users. They have a large, active audience that consumes and multiplies the content published by the influencer. Thus, an influencer's content - whether it is plain text or links - is distributed in a number of micro-networks and receives attention from a large amount of users even though they might not even be direct followers of the influencer. The further the content is spread, the further the influence of the user reaches. There are various tools that enable performance measurement on Social Media. Some only sum up numbers such as the amount of followers or mentions gained on Twitter; others interpret the numbers and rate the performance using a specific algorithm. An example for the latter is Klout, a popular service that will be looked at more closely, focusing on the question of how Klout calculates its scores which serve as a means of measuring success of Twitter usage. The research purpose of this paper is to determine a grounded approach for measuring social networking potential of individual Twitter users."

Study suggests, that stakeholder theory is useful in identifying and prioritizing stakeholders that organization is aware of. However, theory is argued being ineffective in finding stakeholders on new environments (social media), where connectivity and relationships play a key role. The argument stems from the need to assess stakeholder presence beyond the dyadic ties. Consequently, the combination of the Stakeholder Salience Model (SSM) and social network analysis (SNA) is proposed as a more holistic solution for stakeholder identification including those from social media. A process of finding ""unknown"" but important stakeholders from social media was identified incorporating the content search and the principles of SNA. Consequently, stakeholders from social media are identified based on the dimensions of connectivity and the content shared. Accordingly, the study introduces four groups of important actors from social media: unconcerned lurkers, unconcerned influencers, concerned lurkers and concerned influencers and integrates them into the existing Stakeholder Salience Model (SSM). © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The first step for an efficient use of SNSs stems from an understanding of the individuals' behaviors within these sites. In this research, we have obtained a typology of SNS users through a latent segmentation approach, based on the frequency by which users perform different activities within the SNSs, sociodemographic variables, experience in SNSs, and dimensions related to their interaction patterns. Four different segments have been obtained. The ""introvert"" and ""novel"" users are the more occasional. They utilize SNSs mainly to communicate with friends, although ""introverts"" are more passive users. The ""versatile"" user performs different activities, although occasionally. Finally, the ""expert-communicator"" performs a greater variety of activities with a higher frequency. They tend to perform some marketing-related activities such as commenting on ads or gathering information about products and brands as well as commenting ads. The companies can take advantage of these segmentation schemes in different ways: first, by tracking and monitoring information interchange between users regarding their products and brands. Second, they should match the SNS users' profiles with their market targets to use SNSs as marketing tools. Finally, for most business, the expert users could be interesting opinion leaders and potential brand influencers. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

The “nobodies” of the past are now the new “somebodies” demanding the attention of communication professionals who seek continuous engagement with targeted consumers throughout the various channels of the social web. The purpose of this paper is to present a means of identifying these new “somebodies”. Design/methodology/approach – This paper reviews a customizable valuation algorithm created to identify the “new somebodies” who are the influencers creating a revitalized level of brand awareness for companies. The index valuation algorithm measures a crosssection of variables that numerically rate influencers in the social media conversation about a particular company, product or service. Findings – This information helps us understand how these “somebodies” influence traditional target audiences, and help communications professionals establish effective outreach strategies. Integrating the influencer index data into a holistic social media strategy provides a comprehensive social media approach for optimizing brand equity. Originality/value – The index identifies the “conversation points” that should guide engagement with each individual influencer, determining aspects such as subject and tone, and identifies these influencers. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

Most of these services, like Twitter1, Jaiku2 or Tumblr3 provide the option to subscribe to other users, thereby, each post is sent immediately to those who have chosen the option of receiving them. Twitter is the most widely used microblogging system. In it, users publish updates and interact with other members by forwarding updates or quoting users in their posts by mentions or replies. The last feature makes up a large repository of Web information that includes connections between users by associating each link with a textual content.

Replacing traditional customer relationship management (CRM) with a Facebook fan site (for instance) presents advantages but also strategic risks for a brand. If knowledge of brand advocates, High-Value Customers, High-Value Prospects and influencers is considered an asset for the business, the asset needs to be owned and managed over time, and that is not possible in the social-only environment. Social and CRM in combination are likely to be more effective than individually. In linking social data with CRM data, multiple identities, privacy and data protection issues, and which data to hold on the database (vs. leave in the social media cloud) are all challenges that need to be addressed.

The results of this research will give us an idea of the emergence of microblogging as a new medium of influencing human behavior and providing a source of collective intelligence in planning and decision making, specifically in the Australian context. We found that, from our observations, there is a correlation between the inter-state total energy reduction during this campaign with the amount of inter-state online Twitter discussion.

It shows that key decision makers in all major markets operate within communities of influencers- because major decisions are too complex and risky to taken in isolation. The 'ecosystems' this creates are full of these critically important people, whose impact on purchasing decisions is both pivotal and misunderstood. This new book demonstrates that- As mass media impact wanes so the role of influencers grows - marketers need to know why and how to use this knowledge The impact of blogs, wikis and other social media is that they enable new influencers to emerge, and disperse traditional sources of influence. Large and small businesses worldwide pour billions of pounds each year into influencing what they think are their influencers. This book shows you that most of that money is being spent on the wrong people, leaving the real influencers all too often untouched. Influencers do not do the buying, are not obvious, cannot be bought, and start off neutral - which is why their potential to affect sales is so great Influencers are not all equal - they can be assessed, ranked and prioritised to be used effectively Influencers can be influenced - the question is how to get to them to generate market awareness, leads and address sales barriers Influencer marketing is closely related to the relentless rise and success of word of mouth (WOM) and relationship marketing, and is now established as one of the armoury of new techniques professionals must use. For all those involved in marketing and sales this book will be an essential analysis of how to identify who has influence, how they apply it, and how you can turn it to your advantage. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
